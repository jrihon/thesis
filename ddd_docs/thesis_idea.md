# Idea Layout
- Every chapter has a different color for the headers and other coloured attributes


# idea for the cover
Try to get an image that looks like the O'Reilly covers. Something more lifelike.

What I want is to have a crab (Rust), snake (Python), penguin (Linux) and some molecules as the cover art

# idea for headnotes
For every page, that does not contain a new chapter header, add a small line at the top, with a specific colour, and above you can have 
"chapter 1" on even sides (left) and then the title of the chapter "XXX" on uneven sides (right)
