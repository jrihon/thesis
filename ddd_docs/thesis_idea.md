# Idea Layout
- Every chapter has a different color for the headers and other coloured attributes


# idea for the cover
Try to get an image that looks like the O'Reilly covers. Something more lifelike.

What I want is to have a crab (Rust), snake (Python), penguin (Linux) and some molecules as the cover art
