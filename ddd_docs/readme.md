# when should I submit ?

 - at least 9 months after approval of the final doctoral plan (technisch gezien is dit July, but fuck you)
 - minimum 10 weeks before the provisional date of the public defence (technisch gezien is dit ook July, but fuck you)
 - be aware that the doctoral school cannot guarantee that 10 weeks will suffice, so we strongly recommend to leave more time! In case the Examining Committee demands a major revision of the manuscript, the defence will need to be postponed.
 - take into account 3-4 weeks for manuscript revision, (minimum 5-6 weeks if holiday period is included  (Christmas, Easter, July & August),  however jury members can ask for a longer review period), so in that case there needs to be minimum 12 weeks between submission and defence => Try to submit even early as 1st of June
