# Molecular modeling tools to improve and expand computational research on synthetic nucleic acids

## My PhD thesis

All formatting has been personally designed and coded in the `typst` language.

This thesis employs [multi-bibs](https://github.com/jrihon/multi-bibs), a library I wrote to support multiple bibliographies using the `typst` language.

## Typst
Compiled with `typst` version `0.11.0`

Find `typst` and the compiler over at [typst/typst](https://github.com/typst/typst).
