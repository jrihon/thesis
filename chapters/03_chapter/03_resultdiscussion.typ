#lorem(50)
//
// A. Recap what happened previously in C.A.'s work
// - Explain the current experiments run and how the results came to be
//  -> forcefield building and simulated annealing. Not in methods because that is not what I did
// - Explain truncation experiments
//  => experiment with truncating from either side, they came up with core13 and core14 as the best one in SPR experiments
//  => chemically synthesised the strands and did competition studies with known anti-HEL antibodies; camelid came out on top
//  => single alanine scans and charge reversion mutations were introduces. Several site mutations overlapped with mutations needed
//    for camelid and aptamer to bind together, meaning they share common hotspots.
//  => to understand whether or not it has a Gq4, a specific BG4 monoclonal antibody (BG4) was used. Na veel vijven en zessen was it 
//    confirmed (or at least highly likely) that this aptamer contains a G4 quadruplex structure, as the epitope recognised by both 
//      antibodies is largely independent of sugar configuration.
//  => From Suppl. Table 3, we can see that G1, G13, G20 and G23 (not G27) are making up the Gq
//    They saw this because they mutated all Gs to an A and observed inactivity with the first four!
//    => Affinity measured against an antibody that detects quadruplexes
//  => Detailed investigation says that T3, A11 and T29 are also needed for core13 binding or in the aptamer structure folding.
//    Then, for other mutation studies, they also saw that those others seemed to be very important through other mutation studies.
//    => Affinity measured on HEL itself as saw that it didn't work anymore
// - Show the comparison with the camelid epitope (whatever that is)
// - 
//
// B. Show the computational timeline via the modelled structures
// - Start with the 29mer first
// - Go on to do the 33mer after
// -> Finalise with one of the figures I made from the manuscript, the one with the projected aptamer.
// => Talk about the Mg2+ ion that seemed to be very important for model to be stable.
// => There is the scatterplot also, maybe use the plattecarree projection (square) to make a prevalence plot of that scattering
//
// C. Make a hypothetical model of the camlid eptiope vs the HNA aptamer epitope
//
