== Scientific acknowledgements

I want to thank prof. dr. Eveline Lescrinier, prof. dr. Vitor Bernardes Pinheiro and prof. dr. Mathy Froeyen for their help the past four years, on their guidance throughout my years as a PhD candidate on my dissertation and in my personal life. Your discussions mean a great deal to me.  

To dr. Charles-Alexandre Mattelaer and dr. Rinaldo Wander Montalv√£o for discussing topics on molecular modeling and informatics, for helping my with the basics so I could have a headstart on my work.
To Sten Reynders for testing the Ducque and pucke.rs tools and making sure I corrected every small mistake I had left behind.

To dr. Peter Schofield, dr. Alexander Taylor, dr. Cristian D. Pena Martinez, dr. Sacha Zinn, , dr. Jennifer Jackson, dr. Gurpreet Dhaliwal, Guy Schepers, dr. Piet Herdewijn, dr. Daniel Christ and dr. Philipp Holliger for the collaborative effort on capturing the essence and characterising the HNA aptamer, and especially dr. Charles-Alexandre Mattelaer without whom the modeling experiments would have been practically unfeasible. 

To dr. Elisabetta Groaz and dr. Yuqing Xu for allowing me to help them in their work on understanding the mode of action of their novel antiviral compound. 

To dr. Anne-Sophie Depuydt, dr. Olivier Cheneval, dr. Christina I. Schroeder, prof. dr. David J. Craik, dr. Steve Peigneur and prof. dr. Jan Tytgat for inviting me to work on a project completely beyond my scope. It was truly an enjoyable collaboration we were able to produce together.

+ Rihon, J., _et al._ (2024). NAR , #link("https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae135")[10.1093/nar/gkae135].\ Rihon designed and programmed the Ducque software, wrote the implementation for the Merz-Kollman population analysis scheme for the ORCA quantum mechanics package, carried out all the experiments (conformational sampling, MD simulations), derived the force field for the morpholino nucleic acid, analysed the experiments, wrote the manuscript and made the figures.
//
+ Rihon, J. _et al._, (2024). Submitted to JChemInf. \  Rihon designed and programmed the pucke.rs and pucke.py tools, carried out all the experiments (conformational sampling benchmark), analysed the experiments, the deep dive into literature, wrote the manuscript and made the figures.
//
+ Mattelaer, C.-A. _et al._, (2021). JCTC , #link("https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00270")[10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00270].\ Rihon J. performed the conformational sampling experiment on the cyclohexenyl nucleic acid under the guidance of Mattelaer C.-A. and proofread the manuscript.
//
+ Schofield, P. _et al._ (2023). NAR , #link("https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad592")[10.1093/nar/gkad592].\ Rihon J. carried out the structure prediction experiment by iteratively running MD simulations to optimise for the HNA aptamer structure. He made the atomistic and simplified HNA aptamer model figure and the overlay with the canonical DNA Gq.
//
+ Xu, Y. _et al._ (2023). EJMC #link("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115379")[10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115379].\ Rihon J. performed conformational sampling experiments on the xylose nucleic acid, designed a custom force field for the synthetic molecule and ran MD simulations with the nucleic acid - protein - cofactor complex. He also wrote the computational methods and results section of the manuscript, made the atomic model figure in the main manuscript and the prevalence plots in the supplementary information.
//
+ Depuydt, A.-S. _ et al._ (2021). _ACS Pharm. & Trans. Sci._ #link("https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.1c00079")[10.1021/acsptsci.1c00079].\ Rihon J. performed the peptide docking experiment and the subsequent MD simulation on the calcium channel protein, wrote the computational parts of the methods and results.
