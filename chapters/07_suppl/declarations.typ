== Scientific acknowledgements

I want to thank prof. dr. Eveline Lescrinier, prof. dr. Vitor Bernardes Pinheiro and prof. dr. Mathy Froeyen for their help the past four years, on their guidance throughout my years as a PhD candidate on my dissertation and in my personal life. Your discussions mean a great deal to me.  

To dr. Charles-Alexandre Mattelaer and dr. Rinaldo Wander Montalv達o for discussing topics on molecular modeling and informatics, for helping my with the basics so I could have a headstart on my work.
To Sten Reynders for testing the Ducque and pucke.rs tools and making sure I corrected every small mistake I had left behind.

To dr. Peter Schofield, dr. Alexander Taylor, dr. Cristian D. Pe単a Martinez, Sacha Zinn, dr. Jenny Jackson, Gurpreet Dhaliwal, Guy Schepers, dr. Piet Herdewijn, dr. Daniel Christ and dr. Philipp Holliger for the collaborative effort on capturing the essence and characterising the HNA aptamer, and especially dr. Charles-Alexandre Mattelaer without whom the modeling experiments would have been practically unfeasible. 

To dr. Elisabetta Groaz and dr. Yuqing Xu for allowing me to help them in their work on understanding the mode of action of their novel antiviral compound. 

To dr. Anne-Sophie Depuydt, dr. Olivier Cheneval, dr. Christina I. Schroeder, prof. dr. David J. Craik, dr. Steve Peigneur and prof. dr. Jan Tytgat for inviting me to work on a project completely beyond my scope. It was truly an enjoyable collaboration we were able to produce together.
