== Objectives

The title of this dissertation should make clear what the focus of the research project is.

The field currently lacks a streamlined way to carry out computational studies on synthetic nucleic acids.
A number of issues are at the cause, where the first one 
(i) The lack of structural models for XNA in the databanks makes it difficult to
(ii) generate a force field that correctly models the properties of the modifications. 

Added to this, using organic synthesis to make the XNA building blocks is resource intensive and can take months, if not an entire year, to create a set of compounds. This does not account testing their viability in one of the applicative fields.

What we want to do is to concatenate and streamline several methodologies to provide a pipeline in which we can predict the structural properties of the XNA. We want to be able to predict a structure of particular modifications we have a vested interest in to understand their behaviour. 
In order to do so, we need to 
+ Characterise the behaviour of a modification. 
+ Determine a methodology to  

This is especially crucial to determine the way a backbone modification influences the puckering.
