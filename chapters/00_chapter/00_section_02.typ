==== The problem with the current definitions
// Show with a figure how the definition came to be, with the rotation of the vectors
// starting from this point, everything is biased
// Say that in 1998, they even changed the angles of rotation => every previous data is now unusable and has to be redone
// The properties, like roll, twist, propel and stuff .. these are 'properties' asserted by scientists at the time
// A quantitative measure for a phenomenom they can observe in crystals.
// However, no evidence suggests that this makes for a good metric 
// Do a simulation with DNA and RNA and show that, based on these definitions, they're pretty much the same.

==== Curvature Torsion ?
// For CT, change in the trace chain is something we strive for.
// By applying CT to helices that are continuous and can be defined by simple functions, we get small differences that 
// are not significant between A- and B-helices => we want to have a metric that shows differences between those two 
// as that is what actually matters.
