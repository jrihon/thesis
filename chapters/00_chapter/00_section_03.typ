== Fundamentals on the behaviour of molecules
#let content-nucleielectron = [
Now that we have touched upon the application potential of XNAs and discussed how we can geometrically characterise the molecules themselves, we will delve into what constitutes a molecule and how we can accurately describe them fundamentally.
A molecule like a DNA nucleoside is simply a bunch of atoms grouped in such a way it became relevant to life on earth. If we magnify and investigate atoms, we see that they are composed of a nucleus - protons and neutrons - and are cloaked by electrons (@fig-nucleielectron).  
//The field of Computional Chemistry (compchem) concerns itself with describing atoms and molecules by the positioning of the electrons around their nuclei. Asserting their probable whereabouts lets us calculate the energy of the molecular system. 
//In other words, by looking at how the electrons behave in the vicinity of other electrons and the surrounding nuclei, we can eventually make predictions on how molecules interact with other molecules and their environment.
By looking at how the electrons behave in the vicinity of other electrons and the surrounding nuclei, we can eventually make predictions on how molecules interact with other molecules and their environment. This lets us simulate their behaviour through rigorous computations, so we can look at the interactions that e.g. a drug makes within the active site of an enzyme at the atomic scale.

One of the pillars of computational chemistry is quantum mechanics (QM). This scientific field's main mission is to assess the properties of a molecule at a fundamental level.
QM calculations rely on approximations to the Schrödinger equation for multi-electron systems.
Since these calculations are extremely heavy on computational resources, computational chemists have also introduced molecular mechanics (MM).
We can differentiate either field by the timescale at which we study the molecules of interest. While QM studies a system by the positional snapshot of a molecule, MM provides us with means to let molecules move about and interact with each other, giving us a realtime view of how they behave at a nanosecond ($10^(-9)$) to microsecond ($10^(-6)$) timescale. While these calculations are several order of magnitude faster, they bring along an accuracy penalty in favour of the received information. 
The simulated behaviour of molecules is described by a _force field_, which contains information gathered from QM experiments and empirical observations.
//In order for the simulated molecules to virtually move according to their observed behaviour, we design _force fields_ to abstract and compact the information gathered from QM and bring it over to MM.

=== Quantum Mechanics
// Discuss some formal objects and notations for people to understand and interpret concepts in QM
The field of QM studies the principle that every particle, such as an electron, holds a _quantized_ amount of energy. The goal is to be describe the total energy of a system, meaning a collection of atoms and molecules, by the energy of all the individual particles that make up the system.

==== The Schrödinger equation
//The Schrödinger equation forms the foundation of all of compchem 
In the early 20#super("th") century, scientists attempted to understand the nature of atoms and how electron particles behave.
Before considering electrons, a lot of work was done on understanding light phenomena to be able to describe them mathematically.
At first, it was postulated by Albert Einstein that, for a light wave to carry energy, it should also be made up of particles that carry this energy. These photons - which are massless particles - portray a _wave-particle duality_ that was previously unheard of.
Two decades later, de Broglie postulated, through analogy with photons, that electrons could also be characterised by this property. This was then confirmed through the _double slit_ experiment, conducted by Davisson and Germer. Because the _wave-particle duality_ could be attributed to these particles, it would then be conceivable to express their behaviour by a _wave function_. 

In @eq-base-schrodinger we encounter the wave function ($Psi$) that describes the position of atomic particles - nuclei and electrons - in a system. The Hamiltonian (HamilOp) acts as an operator over the wave function and describes how we can calculate for the energy of a system based on the position of these particles.
On the righthand side of the equation, we find the energy $E$ which is the eigenvalue to the eigenfunction $Psi$. 
//This just means that $E Psi$ can be evaluated to the most elementary form of the position of the electrons and this is associated with a discrete amount of energy. 
This just means that there will be a discrete amount of energy $E$ associated with a system of particles, and that energy is determined by the position of the atoms and their electrons within that system.
$
accent("HamilSym", "^") Psi = E Psi
$ <eq-base-schrodinger>
//This function gives us the $accent(ℋ, "^")$ operator, which describes the kinetic ($accent(T, "^")$) and potential ($accent(V, "^")$) energy of the system. We can further divide all this in blablabla
//The $Psi$ is the wave function of system. Squaring the wave function gives us the probability density of finding an electron within a normalised space ($Psi^2$).
//This is for one-dimensional and this is for three-dimensional. This represents an orbital, a volumetric space in which we are very likely to find the electron we are computing for.

//#intermezzo("Operator")[ An operator is just a mathematical entity that takes in a group of values or a function and modifies it. For example, the _summation_ operator '+' is the transformation of adding N amount of values together to output a single value. Here, the HamilOp operator influences the outcome of the wave function $Psi$ by mapping a transformation over all the described electrons of the wave function to return the energy of the electrons. ]

Here, the HamilOp operator acts on the wave function $Psi$ by mapping over all the described atomic particles of the wave function to return the energy $E$ (eigenvalue) of the system and the wave function itself $Psi$ (eigenfunction). ]

When we expand on the HamilOp, we understand that it defines the kinetic ($accent("T", "^")$) and the potential ($accent("V", "^")$) energy of the system. 
$
accent("HamilSym", "^") = accent(T, "^") + accent(V, "^")
$ <eq-hamiltonian-simple>
The individual terms can be further expanded to the Schrödinger equation for a many-body system - meaning more than two electrons and more than two nuclei : 
$
accent("HamilSym", "^") = 
underbrace(
sum^(N_K)_(I=1) - frac(gradient^2_I , 2 M_I) 
+ sum^(n_e)_(i=1) - frac(gradient^2_i , 2) 
, "Kinetic Operator" accent(T, "^")
)
+
overbrace(
 sum^(N_K)_(I=1) sum^(n_e)_(i=1) frac(-Z_I, r_(i I)) 
+ sum^(n_e)_(i=1) sum^(n_e)_(j>i) frac(1, r_(i j)) 
+ sum^(N_K)_(I=1) sum^(N_K)_(J>I) frac(Z_I Z_J, R_(I J))
, "Potential Operator" accent(V, "^")
)
$ <eq-hamiltonian-full>
All uppercase parameters and subscripts pertain to the nuclei, the lowercase ones to the electrons.
The first two terms describe the kinetic energy by the movement of the nuclei, the second that of the electrons.
The latter three terms describe the potential energy of the system. The third term describes the potential energy experienced between each nucleus and each respective electron. In other words, the interaction potential between the $I^(t h)$ nucleus and the $i^(t h)$ electron is evaluated. Since electrons are negatively charged and the nuclei are positively charged, this can be considered the attraction term.
The fourth term considers the pairwise evaluation of each electron with all the other electrons in the system. The fifth term does the same, but with nuclei instead. That is why we denote them the _electronic repulsion_ term and the _nucleic repulsion_ term respectively.

  ]
) <fig-zeeman>
One of the reasons why quantum mechanics holds its name is due to the nature of the electrons. As we have discussed, this field of study attempts to determine the position of the electron in a system of atoms in order to calculate for its energy. What we need to clarify here is that the amount - or quantity - an electron can hold and emit back to the world lies in a discrete spectrum. In other words, we can say that an electron can absorb energy until it is 'full' and then expels that energy to the environment  in the form of photons. Energy transfer is often done through heating or by light emission.

//We have mentioned already that in the field of QM, we study the positioning of the electrons in the vinicity of other electrons and nuclei and try to calculate the energy ($E$) of the system. To be accurate, we must understand that the quantity of energy an electron can hold lies in a discrete spectrum.
//This means that electrons only emit photons after absorbing a set amount of energy, be that through heating or light, before releasing it into their environment.
//
//Before the effects of the magnetic field were published, the spectra of several elements had already been studied (@fig-zeeman A.). However, this was thought to be a property of the atoms themselves.
The absorption and emission spectra of several elements had already been studied (@fig-zeeman A.) but this discrete distribution was initially thought to be a property of the atoms themselves. A scientist by the name of Zeeman considered an experiment where a magnetic field would be brought into play when documenting the spectra of particular elements.
The Zeeman effect showed us that this emission would become split to reveal a discrete subspectrum at certain levels of energy. It wasn't understood until later that when the magnetic field was applied to the molecules, it influences the angular momentum of the electron with respect to the nucleus.

The discrete energy levels were finally categorised into distinct levels that can be computed for using the _quantum numbers_ ($n$, $l$, $m_l$) and formalised into the theory of orbitals we nowadays use to assign the various electrons to discrete levels of energy of a system:  the principal _n_, the orbital angular momentum _l_ and the magnetic _m#sub("l")_.
To keep it as simple as possible, the principal quantum number determines the level in which the electrons reside in. It can be thought of as the atomic model that Niels Bohr proposed, where the electrons circle around in different _shells_ around the nucleus in a fixed orbit. 
The two latter quantum numbers are used to differentiate into sublevels using concepts from spherical harmonics (@fig-zeeman B.).
//however, we see that the discrete spectrum becomes split. As it turns out, the emitted spectra are what we consider to be degenerate and consist of multiple hidden layers that are observable under select conditions.

==== Orbital theory
Before discussing the quantum numbers further, we need to understand a key property of the wave function itself. To remind you, the wave function is an equation that tells us where the electrons are located around the nuclei of a system.
#let content-1d-distr = [
===== Probability density distribution
To solve the Schrödinger equation, we need to be able to employ both the momentum of particle, for $accent("T", "^")$ and to determine their position for $accent("V", "^")$ (@eq-hamiltonian-simple).
The _Heisenberg's uncertainty principle_ tells us we cannot determine both the position and the momentum of an electron at a given time. This stems from either variable to depend on the other one, something we refer to as _conjugate variables_. Because of this uncertainty, we will always need to approximate both parameters to the best of our ability. 

With this in mind, we can use the wave function to our advantage.
//It has the particular property that when taking its square ($Psi^2$), we get returned with the probability distribution of the whereabouts of an electron (@fig-1d-phisquared). This is applied by taking the complex conjugate ($Psi ^*$) of the wave function and apply the dot product to the wave function ($Psi$).

It has the particular property that when squaring ($Psi^2$), we get the probability distribution of the whereabouts of an electron (@fig-1d-phisquared). This is applied by taking the complex conjugate ($Psi ^*$) of the wave function and apply the dot product to the original wave function ($Psi$). 
$
angle.l Psi bar.v Psi angle.r = integral^(+ infinity)_(- infinity) Psi^* (x) Psi (x) d x = 1
$<eq-1d-phisquared>
We can extend this to three dimensions and generalise for a set of $N$ electrons. In order to get the probability, we normalise the wave function before applying this transformation : 
$
angle.l Psi bar.v Psi angle.r = integral ... integral integral integral^(+ infinity)_(- infinity) Psi^* (x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2 ... z_N) Psi (x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2 ... z_N) d v_1 ... d v_N = 1
$ <eq-probability-allelectrons>
We integrate over the volume $v_N$ that describes the location ($x_N, y_N, z_N$) of an electron $e_N$.
To summarise, we can describe the probability of finding an electron within a certain space near a nucleus by utilising @eq-probability-allelectrons.
//we can describe the chance of encountering an electron within a specific volume in space.

//https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics
===== Spherical harmonics
This specific volume in space in which the electron will likely appear in, is tightly linked with the amount of energy the electron holds. As mentioned and illustrated through @fig-zeeman, the quantity of energy they carry lies in a discrete spectrum. For convenience sake, we convert the current equations from a Cartesian system ($x, y, z$) to a spherical system ($r, theta, phi$) to simplify the calculations in the following equations.

To represent the probable volume in which these electrons can appear in, we make use of a concept called _spherical harmonics_. This constitutes a set of orthonormal functions with which we can represent the probability of finding an electron. Through a transformation of the coordinate system, we get the general form of approximating electron positioning (@eq-spherharmonics).  
$
Psi (x, y ,z) => Psi (r, theta, phi) = 
overbrace(
R_(n, l) (r), "Radial component" 
)
underbrace(
Y_(l, m_l) (theta, phi), "Angular component" 
)
$<eq-spherharmonics>
The radial component is further determined by dependence of the nucleic charge of the atom. This means that we can explain why the electrons behave slightly different for particular element we want to describe. The radial component influences the spectra - like those in @fig-zeeman A. - by shifting the wavelength at which absorption and emission happens.
The angular component actually describes the spherical harmonics part. This latter component expands into a set of _Legendre polynomials_, which is a collection of predefined polynomials used to practically compute for the angular component.

)<fig-orbitals>
@fig-orbitals shows us the three dimensional probability distribution of finding an electron for a given energy level. These functions are calculated using the angular component of @eq-spherharmonics  using the $l$ and $m_l$ quantum numbers.
Three different orbitals are depicted, which are described by the component $Y(l, m_l)$. From left to right, we see $Y(0, 0)$ associated with $s$-type orbitals, $Y(1, 0)$ associated with $p_0$-type orbitals and $Y(2, 0)$ associated with $d_0$-type orbitals.

Only two electrons can be found at most per populated orbital. A fourth quantum number, the spin $m_s$, is introduced where electrons are characterised by either a _spin up_ ($alpha$, $frac(1,2)$) or _spin down_ ($beta$,$-frac(1,2)$) and allows us to distinguish either particle within the same orbital. This intrinsic property resulted in the _Pauli exclusion principle_, which will become important with respect to the antisymmetry property that electrons exert onto the wave function. This property is inherent to particles with a half spin and therefore the wave function should be corrected to satisfy this property.
The spin itself does not contribute to the HamilOp.   

//
//
==== Solving the wave function $Psi$
Because the full expression in @eq-hamiltonian-full can be so incredibly complex to compute for, researchers are always searching for ways to simplify an equation in order to make the computational cost of solving it cheaper.
These approximations instantiated the _variational theorem_ that states we could then never achieve the true energy $E$ of the wave function this way, but merely an approximated value $E'$ that will always be slightly higher in energy.
Nevertheless, the introduction of the _Born-Oppenheimer approximation_ is one paradigm that has faciliated research on atomic systems.

//
//
===== Born-Oppenheimer approximation
This simplification of the Schrödinger equation stems from the fact that the nucleus moves at a much slower pace than electrons do. This is because the mass of protons is roughly two thousand times larger. We can consider that in the timeframe in which the electrons travel a particular distance, the protons would remain stationary. Applying this principle of _frozen nuclei_ - frozen in space, mind you - we can derive the _electronic Schrödinger equation_.

+ C
, "Potential Operator" accent(V, "^")
)
$<eq-electron-schrodinger>
If we consider the nuclei at a standstill, this means their kinetic energy goes to zero as they hold no velocity. Since they do not move, we do not need to account for a change in positions of the nuclei with respect to their repulsion. In other words, we can safely assume that the nucleic repulsion term will not vary, therefore becoming a constant value. What we end up with is an expression where we consider (i) the kinetic energy of the individual electrons (ii) the attraction of the electrons to the stationary nuclei (iii) the repulsion of the electrons by each other and lastly (iv) the repulsion of stationary nuclei - a constant value (@eq-electron-schrodinger).

//
//
===== Many-body problem for electrons
Continuing this subsection, we need to highlight the fact that for a system with more than two electrons it is impossible to analytically solve @eq-electron-schrodinger, even with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The main reason lies in the _electronic repulsion term_. 

Consider a set of electrons $S(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, ... e_N)$. While they move about freely, they experience repulsion from other electrons. This means that the momentum and position of $e_1$ depends on the movement and positions of ($e_2, e_3, e_4, ... e_N$), same goes for $e_2$ depending on ($e_1, e_3, e_4, ... e_N$) and so on. The problem becomes too convoluted, as there arise too many factors and variables to account for, for which we know no analytical solution to. This particular problem is generalisable to _classical mechanics_, where it even occupied the likes of Sir Isaac Newton with respect to the movement of celestial bodies.

Handling the electrons in this way would make it impossible to derive a good estimate of the electronic repulsion term.
Luckily, we can further simplify the equation so that we may nonetheless derive a value close to the true $E$ that accompagnies the state of its eigenfunction $Psi$.
//https://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/jenkins/mbody/mbody3.html
//impossible to solve because the behaviour of e1 depends on e2, e3... eN ; that of e2 on e1, e3 ... eN and so on. The equation knows no analytical solution, but can be numerically approximated, which is good enough.
//===== Variational theorem
//Because we approximate, we may never state that we can find the true ground state of a function
//
//Exchange symmetry : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoL5SikmPz8
//
//

==== Hartree-Fock (HF)
One way to simplify this repulsion term is by considering the idea that the electrons could move without interference from other electrons. While in reality we know this to be false, this assumption makes for new equations that are solved numerically and approach the experimentally determined values of $E$ rather well.

//
//
//
===== Basis sets
Before we touch on the actual HF method, we need to clarify what a basis set is. When initialising the computations, it is necessary to define the atomic orbitals ($phi.alt_i$) to calculate for the energy of an electron. However, starting from scratch every time would make calculating for the position of the electron wildly more time intensive. Instead, we predefine a set of basis function ($chi_i$) that closely resembles the orbitals ($phi.alt_i$) already. These basis functions are described through an adaptation of the spherical harmonics. A set of basis functions is called a basis set, which comprises finetuned functions for every element it describes. This means that whenever we start a new computation, we can query the desired basis functions for a set of electrons and get rather close to the most favourable shape of the atomic orbitals already.
$
phi.alt_i = sum^b_(s=1) c_(s i) chi_s
$<eq-basisset>
@eq-basisset denotes that a linear combination of basis functions $chi_i$, with their respective coefficient $c_(s i)$, can define an atomic orbital. 
The coefficient $c_(s i)$ itself acts as a weighting factor to the $chi_i$ itself. Since we start from predefined orbitals, we still need to optimise the $phi.alt_i$ for the specific system we want to study. This is achieved by doing an iterative search for the optimal values of the coefficients. The optimised set of $c_(s i)$ should yield the lowest energy possible for a given molecular system. This numerical approach is the most time-consuming step in the HF method, as convergence of a value for $E$ needs to be reached. This method is called the _Self Consistent Field_ (SCF). The more atoms present, the larger the amount of basis functions and the more coefficients in need of optimisation.

One thing to mention is that we can define the $chi_i$ from established principles of quantum mechanics without extrinsic information needed. If we can predict how the orbital should look like, we can optimise basis functions for it. This is what we call _ab initio_ QM, as opposed to _semiempirical_ QM that reaches for data from wet lab experiments.
//===== LCAO
//Because we simplify to the independent positioning of the electrons, we ultimately simplify the idea of what a molecular orbital ($psi_i$) is. By defining a hybridised orbital as a _Linear Combination of Atomic Orbital_ (LCAO) and add the contribution of their possible _overlap_ in atomic orbitals to the energy of the system. These _overlap integrals_ simulate as though the $phi.alt_i$ were actually hybridised into a $psi_i$.

//
//
//
===== Slater Determinant (SD) 
The Slater Determinant follows from the Pauli principle to make sure the wave function $Psi$ is antisymmetric. We understand that every electron is labelled by a particular position and spin orbital.
Suppose we have two electrons : $x_1 = phi.alt_(1s)(r_1) alpha(s_1)$ and $x_2 = phi.alt_(2s)(r_2) beta(s_2)$.
To satisfy the antisymmetry rule, the wave function should change sign when $x_1$ and $x_2$ have been exchanged from their respective position and spin orbital. This entails swapping the second electron's position $x_2(r_2)$ to $phi.alt_(1s)$ and its spin direction $x_2(s_2)$ to $alpha$, and vice versa.
$
Psi (x_1, x_2) = - Psi (x_2, x_1)
$ <eq-incorrect-antisym>
It was determined that exchanging the electrons from position and spin orbital did not result in the inversion of the sign of the wave function. This can be remedied by :
$
Psi(x_1, x_2) = frac(1, sqrt(2)) phi.alt_(1s)(r_1) phi.alt_(2s)(r_2) 
overbrace(
[alpha(s_1) beta(s_2) - beta(s_1) alpha(s_2)], "antisymmetric"
)
$<eq-correct-antisymmetry>
$
Phi_(S D) = frac(1, sqrt(2))
mat( delim: "|",
  phi.alt_(1s)(r_1)alpha(s_1), phi.alt_(2s)(r_2)beta(s_2) ;
  phi.alt_(1s)(r_2)alpha(s_2), phi.alt_(2s)(r_1)beta(s_1);
)
$ <eq-SD-form>
Adding this to the equation satisfies the antisymmetry of the wave function. For $N$ electrons, this contribution becomes an $N times N$ matrix to relate all pairwise exchanges and is termed the Slater Determinant (@eq-SD-form). The $frac(1, sqrt(2))$ term is the normalisation factor for $N = 2$.

//
//
===== HF equation
With the SCF methodology, we can consider the Fock operator (FockOp) that works out the energy for every populated orbital through the HF method (@eq-h-fock).
$
accent(f, "^") phi.alt_i = epsilon.alt_i phi.alt_i
$<eq-h-fock>
Assuming uncorrelated movement of the electrons does not mean we can abandon the terms that describe electron-electron interactions. In @eq-h-fock-full, #math.accent("h", "^") describes the energy of the individual electrons. The #math.accent("J", "^") describes the coulombic repulsion between electrons, while the exchange operator #math.accent("K", "^") accounts for the antisymmetric contribution.
$
accent(f, "^") = 
overbrace(
  accent(h, "^"), "one-electron operator"
)
+ 
underbrace(
  sum^(n_b)_(i=1) (2 accent(J, "^")_j - accent(K, "^")_j), "two-electron operators"
)
$<eq-h-fock-full>

As stated before, the HF method does not explicitly deal with electron correlation when optimising for orbitals and hence minimising the uncertainty of the location of the electron. This is a significant caveat to the methodology. The two-electron operators in @eq-h-fock-full concern themselves with the average position of the respective electrons, which means that for overlapping orbitals it cannot be excluded that two electrons occupy the same position in space, which is an unrealistic outcome. While the HF method is still serving as a major contributions to the successes in QM, we can be more precise when it comes to treating electronic interactions. 

//#pagebreak()
//
//
==== Density Functional Theory (DFT)
//The DFT method differs in two ways from the HF method. For starters, instead of assessing the position of electrons, it deals with the electron density $rho(r)$ of an electron's orbital.
//The second is that by this density $rho(r)$, it allows to treat electron correlation implicitly.
We remember @eq-probability-allelectrons, where squaring $Psi$ gives us the probability of encountering an electron in a normalised range, where integrating over the position ($x,y,z$) returned a volume ($d v$) in which the electron could be found. Instead of searching the most probable position of an electron, the Density Functional Theory exploits the volume ($d v$) to work out the electron density ($rho$) in the given volume.
One of the most notable approaches is the Kohn-Sham (KS) approximation, which estimates the electronic repulsion term as the density of all the electrons. However, they reintroduce one-electron orbitals ($phi.alt^(K S)$) in the field of DFT to more accurately account for the kinetic energy $T$ in electron-electron interactions.
The condition of this approach is that the electrons that occupy the KS-orbitals ($phi.alt^(K S)$) are supposedly part of a hypothetical system in which the electrons are non-interacting, which allows us to treat the kinetic energy $T$ as a sum of all the $phi.alt^(K S)_i$. This is similar to the HF method. Appended to it all is the _exchange correlation_ contribution, a correction term to improve the accuracy of the energy estimate. As we can iteratively optimise for the optimal density of a system, we can say that DFT implicitly correlates the movement of electrons. 
//These Kohn-Sham orbitals $phi.alt^(K S)$ - named after both scientists that worked on the problem - deal with the electron density within the one-electron orbitals rather than the uncertainty of their position.
//When starting a computation - analogous to the HF method - an initial guess is made towards the density of the $phi.alt^(K S)$. Every iteration, the density of the orbital is optimised until convergence is reached, meaning a minimal energy $E[rho]$ is reached. One main difference to point out in this methodology, with respect to the HF method, is that because the various $phi.alt^(K S)_i$ are affected by a _repulsion term_, the densities can be optimised in a way that the movement of the electrons are implicitly correlated.

//==== Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MPn)
==== Correlated Wave Function Theory (WFT)
Up to now, we've always discussed the Schrödinger equation in terms of populated orbitals for a set amount of electrons. For wave function theory, we are able to explicitly correlate the interactions between the electrons by adding a correlation term $Phi_(c o r r)$ and to make use of an additional set of unoccupied - or virtual - orbitals.
How this correlation works is that electrons are moved to these virtual orbitals, leaving behind a unoccupied orbital themselves. This impacts the exchange operator $accent(K, "^") $ and thus the Slater Determinant (SD) $Phi_(S D)$. Depending on how many electrons are exchanged to virtual orbitals at a time - one, two, three or more - we obtain a new SD for _single_ ($Phi_S$), _double_ ($Phi_D$), _triple_ ($Phi_T$) or more excitation states. Every determinant now contains information on the effects of the absence of electrons in the system, which gives us the correlation between electrons. We can think of this as the difference in exchange contribution before and after one or more electrons 'leaves' the system. A linear combination of the various $Phi_(S D, i)$ gives us the $Phi_(c o r r)$.
To clarify, these are not orbitals in higher energetic states - as the _excitation_ could suggests - but simply fictive orbitals that have a functional purpose for the methodology. 

This can be further expanded by several methods, of which the Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MPPT) is used often throughout this thesis.

=== Force fields : the ultimate interface
//
Fundamentally speaking, the energy of a molecule is defined by the relative positioning of the orbitals in a molecule. Because these QM computations are expensive to run, attempting to model the movement of the atoms for molecules like large proteins becomes nearly inconceivable. However, by abstracting atomic properties to classical mechanics concepts, we are able to reduce the expensiveness of the calculations. 

In our lab, we employ the AMBER software package to run calculations where we simulate the behaviour of the molecules we want to study. 
To encapsulate the essence of a standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a set of molecules are spawned inside a virtually limitless box where they are 'free' to roam about. The properties of the molecules are defined by the _force field_, which tells us how the molecules are allowed to behave, and most important, restricts unfavoured behaviour.
Every MM software package, like AMBER (@eq-AMBER), has a specific implementation of a force field.

//The quantum mechanical section makes the reader understand that the energy of a molecular system is defined by the position of the nuclei, to which the electrons will accomodate for an optimal position in space. We know that molecules are dynamic in nature, but trying to log the movement of a large set of atoms - like a protein - through QM would be nearly impossible as these calculations are incredibly resource intensive. 
//By abstracting properties of the molecules we want to describe, we can achieve make these molecules move and interact with eachother through classical particle physics. 
//
//Exactly how we condense the characteristics of a molecule is dependent on the software package used. In our lab, we employ the AMBER MD software package.
//
The following expression (@eq-AMBER) describes how the position - or coordinates ($x,y,z$) - of the atoms in a system relate to the potential energy of this system.   
$
E#sub("amber") = E#sub("bondstretch") + E#sub("anglebend")  + E#sub("torsion") + E#sub("electrostatic") + E#sub("LJ")
$ <eq-AMBER>
//@eq-AMBER gives a brief overview of how AMBER's simulation engine derives the potential energy of a system.
The first three terms are defined as the bonded-term interactions. All bonded interactions can be condensed to bonds, angles and dihedrals, which are respectively composed of two, three and four atoms linked together.
The final two are the nonbonded-term interactions, concerned with attractive and repulsive effects within and around the molecule and at least one dihedral's length away #mcite(("Cornell19952ndgenff"), biblio).
While the simulation runs, the atoms move within their bounds. Every shift in movement, all atoms in the system take a slightly different position within the box. Bad movements get penalized, while good movements are left as is. Deciding on the alignment of a movement depends on the results of @eq-AMBER.

    *A.* Bond stretching: An atomic bond can be compressed or drawn out and will be biased towards a length where the atoms a#sub("1") and a#sub("2") are in equilibrium with one another ($r#sub("eq")$).
    *B.* Angle bending : the atoms b#sub("1") and b#sub("3") can rock back and forth, while remaining tied to b#sub("2"). The equilibrium angle ($theta#sub("eq")$) assigns the equilibrium of the three atoms in which they are allowed to exist.

bond between two atoms can be represented through an adapted Newtonian potential energy equation (@eq-ballspring), commonly referred to as the _ball-spring_ model. Here, the _K#sub("r")_ refers to the _stiffness_ of the spring that connects the atoms. Like a spring, the bond between two atoms, here a#sub("1") and a#sub("2"), can compress and stretch ever so slightly.
They are allowed to vary around
their equilbrium value (_r#sub("eq")_), meaning they constantly dance around a set distance, a length defined by the force field (@fig-bondsangleparams A.). //Angle bending is little different from bond stretching, but involves a virtual spring between two atoms, b#sub("1") and b#sub("3"), being indirectly linked

Angle bending is little different from bond stretching, but involves a virtual spring between two atoms, b#sub("1") and b#sub("3"), being indirectly linked through b#sub("2"). The _K#sub(math.theta)_ parameter defines the rigidity of this particular spring, which hovers around the equilbrium angle _θ#sub("eq")_.
These parameters are originally derived from spectroscopy data and normal mode analysis, but can also be retrieved from NMR and _ab initio_ computations, and have remained relatively stable since they were established #mcite(("Cornell19952ndgenff", "Wang2004GAFF"), biblio). This especially holds true for ground-state organic molecules.

===== Fitting torsional parameters <sec-intro-dihedrals>
//https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series
Describing the dihedral angle or torsion angle in a set of four atoms is perhaps the most complicated part of fitting bonded-term parameters, to create a force field that approximates molecular realism.
A dihedral is defined as the angle ($phi$) by which two planes intersect (@fig-torsionexplain A.). As a trigonometric axiom states that three points define a plane, two planes can be defined from a set of four directly bonded atoms if they share two communal points. 
A dihedral's importance lies in the 1-4 interaction it makes. In other words, the atoms d#sub("1") and d#sub("4") in the dihedral set are directly correlated with establishing a part of the potential energy. This is mainly asserted through their steric hindrance, which is the result of a combination of the effects of (i) the radii of the various atoms composing the dihedral, (ii) types of hybridisation in the set (which define bondlength and angles) and (iii) the dihedral angle $phi$.
//
$
E#sub("torsion") = sum_("dihedrals") frac(V#sub("n"), 2) [1 + cos(n phi - gamma)]
$ <eq-torsions>
//
@fig-torsionexplain B. is to be understood alongside @eq-torsions. The change of potential as a result of torsional rotation is defined through Fourier series #mcite(("Kania2021Fouriertorsion"), biblio). Fourier series are composed of multiple periodical functions, which are used to describe these torsion terms.
@eq-torsions describes the _force constant_ ($V_n$) which defines the height of the amplitude, the _multiplicity_ ($n$) defines the amount of minima in the continuous function and ($gamma$) is the _phase_ of the function. The $phi$ angle here is the empirical dihedral angle.
 For example, the resultant periodic in @fig-torsionexplain B. is the summation of the following periods :
$
#text(fill: rgb("#CD827B"))[$E#sub("dihedral")$] #h(1em)= #h(1em)

) <fig-torsionexplain>
This is the typical profile of a (-CH#sub("2")-CH#sub("2")-CH#sub("2")-CH#sub("2")-) dihedral #mcite(("Wang2004GAFF"), biblio).
The figure tells us that when the atom d#sub("4") eclipses d#sub("1"), synonymous with a _syn configuration_, the potential rests at a local minimum. By increasing $phi$, we give a slight rise to the potential because d#sub("4")'s hydrogen atoms are hindering vicinal atoms, causing an unfavourable predicament ($plus.minus frac(2pi,3)$). The system will want to strive for a minimum, which can be achieved by visiting the _anti configuration_, at $phi = pi$. Since the molecule is symmetrical in nature, increasing the torsion angle to $2pi$ will see the potential go through the same changes, ending at a full rotation of the angle $phi$.

By populating a force field with suitable parameters for $V_n$, $n$ and $gamma$ pertaining the specific dihedrals, we can evaluate any rotation of the torsional angle occurring during an MD simulation.

==== Non-bonded term parameters
// Molecular Orbitals = LCAO (atom orbitals - ϕ)
// Charges are a way to quantitatively compute for dipole moments -> hydrogen bridges, london dispersion
// There are multiple ways, like Mulliken en Lowdin.
// Also Merz-Kollman, CHELPG, CHELMO and stuff ...
// How does Merz work, show the figure and yeah
// Say that ORCA's vpot works by using the orbital densities from QM and effectively uses the functions in order to return ESP values on the respective gridpoints.
===== Point charge derivation
//From the field of QM, we know that the charge distribution of atoms in a molecule can be described through the MO functions. Exploiting the information on orbitals directly would prove extremely inefficient when going into classical mechanics. This is because movement of the molecule during the simulation would need constant reevaluation of the orbitals, in order to calculate the dipole moment between two respective atoms.
The coulombic contribution is applied by the design of point charges. This type of charge is uniform across the atom and static during the simulation, meaning the value of the charge is queried from the force field instead of a continuous calculation of the specific parameter, which is an extreme gain in computational efficiency. @eq-charges-in-amber describes pairwise energy evaluation between atoms involved in intra- and intermolecular interactions.
The $q_i$ and $q_j$ parameters are the charges of the two atoms being evaluated and $r_("ij")$ is the distance between them. 
//
$
//E_("electrostatic") = sum_(i<j)  frac(e^2 q_("i")q_("j"), r_("ij"))
E_("electrostatic") = sum_(i<j)  frac(q_("i")q_("j"), r_("ij"))
$ <eq-charges-in-amber>
//
Deriving point charges from quantum mechanical information is done by population analysis (PA) schemes. Most famous are the Mulliken and Löwdin PA schemes #mcite(("Mulliken1955", "Lowdin1950"), biblio), whose applications are to directly use orbital density to fit charges onto the molecule #mcite(("Sigfridsson1998ComparePAschemes"), biblio).
In MM applications however, the PA schemes take on a different approach. In protocols like Merz-Kollman (MK) and CHELPG, charges are least-squared fitted onto the atoms from Electrostatic Potential (ESP) data.

The MK scheme is the protocol used for AMBER-compatible force fields (@fig-mkscheme). 
The surface around the molecule is defined by the Connolly algorithm #mcite(("Connolly1983SASA"), biblio), which asserts the Solvent-Accesssible Surface (SAS) around the molecule - e.g. a morpholino adenosine (@fig-mkscheme A.). By modifying atomic radii by a respective factor of 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0, a grid is defined that encloses the molecule (@fig-mkscheme B.). 
From the QM side, a calculation is carried out at the HF/6-31G\* level - the HF method using the 6-31G\* basis set. The information on the orbital density from this calculation is mapped onto the grid, assigning an potential value to every grid point. The collection of energised grid points is called the ESP (@fig-mkscheme C.). This ESP will be determined by the presence, or conversely the absence, of electrons in that particular volume.

By fitting the ESP onto the atoms, using the _Chirlian-Francl_ least-squared fitting procedure, we derived ESP-based partial charges #mcite(("Chirlian1987fit"), biblio) (@fig-mkscheme D.). 
An additional procedure to these derived charges is the application of the restrained ESP (RESP) protocol #mcite(("Bayly1993resp"), biblio). This protocol is necessary to equate similar atoms, like the hydrogens (HN41, HN42) in the amine of the purine. Restraints are also applied to account for buried atoms. Due to the grid being defined by the surface of the molecule, atoms like the carbons in the methylene moieties (-CH#sub("2")-) of the morpholino ring will be underrepresented, since they are shadowed by their hydrogens. Restraining these _degenerate hydrogens_ will balance out the result. Upon completing the scheme, the user is returned with point charges for all the atoms in the system.

Other charge derivation schemes, like CHELPG and CHELMO differ in protocol like grid generation (e.g. cubic grids) and the applied basis sets and methods used #mcite(("Sigfridsson1998ComparePAschemes"), biblio).

===== Lennard-Jones potential
Atoms are not only interacting through attraction and repulsion based on fixed charges, but also experience these forces through instantaneous dipole moment. These are fleeting moment in which atoms can induce a dipole in other atoms, creating an momentary shift in repulsive force. This phenomenom is known as the _London dispersion_. Due to the 'cloud' of electrons cloaking the core of an atom, they portray an _atomic radius_ that sterically hinder other atoms from getting too close as these clouds repulse each other (@fig-lennardjones).
We often refer to @eq-lenardjones as the 12-6 potential or Lennard-Jones potential.

The $R_("min,ij")$ is the optimal distance between two atoms where the Lennard-Jones potential is at its minimum at a well depth $epsilon_("ij")$.
To give a physical representation, we can think of the $R_("min,ij")$  and $epsilon_("ij")$ parameters as a link to Van der Waals radii of the atoms #mcite(("Li2015ljpotential", "Sengupta2021ljpotential"), biblio).

  The first term computes for the repulsion between two atoms and the second term for the London dispersion forces. The $R_("min,ij") = R_("min,i") + R_("min,j")$ is calculated by the adding the two 'radii' together. The potential well depth is derived by $epsilon_("ij") = sqrt(epsilon_i epsilon_j)$. Both parameters are brought forth from the Berthelot-Lorentz combining rules.

===== Special cases for ions in nonbonded-term interactions
To account for ionic atoms, the nonbonded-term need specific revisions. For the Lennard-Jones potential, ions represent a particular population of atoms that induce strong dipole moments in other atoms. To account for this, @eq-lenardjones is appended with a final term, making it the 12-6-4 potential. 
In @eq-ions-nonbonded, the proton charge of the ion is taken into account by the parameter $e$, relevant in multivalent ions like Mg#super("2+") and Fe#super("3+") #mcite("Li2015ljpotential", biblio). 
These additions are extremely important, as many biomolecular simulations are run using ions to simulate biological conditions.

=== Molecular mechanics
//To encapsulate the essence of a standard Molecular Dynamics simulations, a set of molecules are spawned inside a virtually limitless box. The properties of the molecules are defined in several files located on the machine - the _force field_. These files supply the simulation engine with information on how the molecules are allowed to behave, and most important, restrict unfavoured behaviour. The engine itself is the program that lets the molecules move about, logs and corrects the motion of molecules.
==== Making the molecules move
While quantum mechanics approximates the Schrödinger equation to retrieve the energy of small molecules, molecular mechanics performs atomistic simulations that can handle thousands of atoms at a time. One way of applying this, is by carrying out a molecular dynamics simulation: a long and continuous calculation that is steered by the provided force field. The word simulation is important here because we attempt to recreate what happens to the molecules we want to study in real life. The virtual atoms are 'free' to move about and are left to make instantaneous interactions with the possibility of stabilising.
To correctly represent the movement of the atoms, MD makes use of classical mechanics to model the dynamic trajectory through Newton's equation of motion : 
$
f_i = m_i a_i #h(1em) arrow.r #h(1em) f_i = m_i frac(d^2 r_i, d t^2) = - frac(diff, diff r_i) U(r_1, r_2, ... r_N)
$ <eq-classnewtion>
The $r_i$ represent the $i#super("th")$ atom's position in cartesian space. The potential energy function $U(r_1, r_2, ..., r_N)$ is determined by the force field (@eq-AMBER) and calculates the potential based on those positions, for a total of $N$ particles #mcite(("Gonzalez2011ffandmd"), biblio).

@eq-classnewtion is a non linear second order differential equation that cannot be solved exactly. This is the reason why we need a numerical integrator that partitions the trajectory into small, discrete segments. Every segment is what is called a timestep, an amount of time spanning before and after the movement of the atoms. Because these particles are almost infathomably tiny, they move around quickly and therefore the timestep to observe their movement needs to be small as well; usually around 1 femtosecond ($10^(-15)$ s). 
When we discretise this equation, we essentially want to know the position of the atoms ($r_i$) as a function over the elapsed time ($t_0 + Delta t$) (@eq-discrete-numerical) (@fig-periodic A.).
$
r_i (t_0) #h(1em) arrow.r #h(1em) r_i (t_0 + Delta t) #h(1em) arrow.r #h(1em) r_i (t_0 + 2Delta t) #h(1em) arrow.r #h(1em) ... #h(1em) arrow.r #h(1em) r_i (t_0 + n Delta t)

//What makes @eq-classnewtion non linear is that the variable $m_i$ - the mass of the $i#super("th")$ atom - acts as a coefficient on the second order derivative, whereas a constant value would make it linear. 
What makes it analytically unsolvable is that we cannot write this equation as a linear combination of elementary functions; i.e. a possible linear combination of polynomial and logarithmic functions. To return values for the potential energy however, we have to integrate the function and solve per timestep of motion - a numerical solution. This is computationally less efficient but gets the job done.
]

To make this workable, we can make use of a Taylor expansion by: 
$
r_i (t_0 + Delta t) = r_i (t_0) + frac(d r_i (t_0),d t) Delta t + frac(1,2) frac(d^2 r_i (t_0),d t^2) Delta t^2 + frac(1,6) frac(d^3 r_i (t_0),d t^3) Delta t^3+ 𝒪 (Delta t^4)
$ <eq-taylorexpansion-motion>
Which is just the _kinematic's equation of motion_ : 
$
r_i (t_0 + Delta t) = r_i (t_0) + v_i (t_0) Delta t + frac(1,2) a_i (t_0) Delta t^2 + frac(1,6) b_i  Delta t^3+ 𝒪 (Delta t^4)
$ <eq-kinematicsmotion>
#intermezzo("Taylor series")[
As some differential equations cannot be analytically solved, we search to approximate the polynomial function. Every approximation has a slight error margin. In Taylor expansions, this is denoted by the $𝒪(Delta t^4)$ term for this particular expression. The error here is a function of the timestep $Delta t$, meaning if we take our step small enough, we should be able to reasonably calculate for the next positions of the atoms.
]
We will make use of the _Verlet integration_ - the numerical integrator. In order to computationally optimise the equation to get the $r_i$ at timestep $t_0 + Delta t$, we determine the equations at the next ($+ Delta t$) and the previous ($- Delta t$) timestep and sum them up.
$
r_i (t_0 + Delta t) = r_i (t_0) + frac(d r_i (t_0),d t) Delta t + frac(1,2) frac(d^2 r_i (t_0),d t^2) Delta t^2 + frac(1,6) frac(d^3 r_i (t_0),d t^3) +  𝒪 (Delta t^4)\

r_i (t_0 - Delta t) = r_i (t_0) - frac(d r_i (t_0),d t) Delta t + frac(1,2) frac(d^2 r_i (t_0),d t^2) Delta t^2 - frac(1,6) frac(d^3 r_i (t_0),d t^3) +  𝒪 (Delta t^4)\
  arrow.b.double \
$ <eq-verlet-sum>
$
r_i (t_0 + Delta t) = - r_i (t_0 - Delta t) + 2 r_i (t_0) + frac(1,2) frac(d^2 r_i (t_0),d t^2) Delta t^2 +  𝒪 (Delta t^4) 
$ <eq-verlet-integration>
If we substitute for the acceleration term, we get :
$
r_i (t_0 + Delta t) = - r_i (t_0 - Delta t) + 2 r_i (t_0) + a_i (t_0) Delta t^2 +  𝒪 (Delta t^4)  
$ <eq-verlet-integration-simp>
As it turns out, summing both equations in @eq-verlet-sum and solving for $r_i (t_0 + Delta t)$ cancels out the velocity and the jerk.
The neat part is that when we actually calculate for the next position (@eq-verlet-integration), we can already fill in $r_i (t - Delta t)$ as this has just been computed in the previous timestep.
This means that whenever we need to calculate the next position of the atoms, we only need to current position $r_i$ - found by a simple lookup, the precomputed previous position $r_i (t_0 - Delta t)$ and the current acceleration $a_i$ (@eq-verlet-integration-simp).

At the start of an MD simulation, we have to account for the fact that $r_i (t - Delta t)$ and $a_i$ cannot be solved as no time has elapsed just yet. To accomodate, these parameters are filled in by the _random seed_ of the computer's system. As such, an estimate is given to start off the actual simulation.

==== Periodic boundaries
When an MD experiment starts, the atoms of the system are spawned inside a virtual box. An enclosed box with boundaries that atoms would collide with will impact the course of motion of all atoms in the system. To circumvent this problem, periodic boundaries are implemented. This benefits the engine as it does not need to account for atoms wandering off into infinity - this would cause a simulation to crash anyway - and this simplifies keeping the modelled pressure and temperature constant during the experiment. To clarify this last part, we account for environmental factors to properly model the kinetic energy of a system, which impacts the total energy.  

We can make an analogy of these periodic boundaries to the 1980's Japanese retro game Pac-man. When playing, we can teleport from to right side to the left and vice versa to evade ghosts. This is the same with atoms, whenever an atom goes out-of-bounds, it is spawned on the opposite side of the box (@fig-periodic B).

==== Computational optimisations to MD simulations
Performing MD simulations requires the necessary hardware to run these demanding calculations. 
When these simulations were gaining traction in the scientific fields (ca. 1980's), computational resources were limited.
To give some perspective, computers only had a single core CPU with a memory capacity (RAM) of 512 KiB to roughly 2 MiB at best. Nowadays, my five-year old laptop has six cores and a RAM capacity of about 12 GiB - 6000 times more than a common personal computer of that time. Presumably, a computational lab would have had slightly better resources. 
//These calculations require quite the resources to run, especially considering the fact that these calculations have been around since at least the 1980's and optimisations were a necessity and not a luxury. To give some perspective, computers only had a single core CPU with a memory capacity (RAM) of 512 KiB to roughly 2 MiB at best. Nowadays, my five-year old laptop has six cores and a RAM capacity of about 12 GiB - 6000 times more than a common personal computer of that time. Presumably, a computational lab would have had slightly better resources. 

Being efficient with storing data in memory and downsizing the amount of calculations needed for the entire simulation was a must. There are several ways to do so that are still of use in today's time :

===== Verlet list
There is no way to go around computing the bonded-term interactions, but having to calculate the pairwise interaction potential (@eq-charges-in-amber, @eq-lenardjones) between atom#sub("i") and all other atoms in the system would be a gargantuan task and beyond a certain distance this would garner negligible additions to the potential.
To remedy this, a simulation employs a _cut-off_ distance at which the nonbonded-terms are not evaluated anymore. This is formalised by the _Verlet list_ #mcite(("Chialvo1990verlet"), biblio).

Suppose we set the cut-off distance $d_c$ at 10 Å from atom#sub("i") and a buffer distance $d_b$ at an additional half of $d_c$. Every iteration, a distance check is in place before evaluating the terms. If an atom#sub("j") strays further than 15 Å, the Verlet list for that atom#sub("i") is re-evaluated to include a new set of atoms within $d_c + d_b$.
While this requires some additional RAM to store the lists in, a table lookup is much faster than evaluating the distance between all the atoms in the system on every iteration, considering the euclidian distance is determined through $d = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 +(z_i - z_j)^2)$.
//While this requires some additional RAM to store the lists in, a table lookup is much faster than evaluating all the atoms in the system on every iteration considering the euclidian distance is simply calculated by $d = sqrt((x_i - x_j) + (y_i - y_j) +(z_i - z_j))$

===== Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)

This method is particularly applied to electrostatic interactions between atoms that make use of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) (@fig-periodic B.), where the system's net charge is equal to zero.
The method differentiates two types of $E_("electrostatic")$ , namely the short-range ($E_("direct")$) and the long-range ($E_("reciprocal")$). This range is decided by the cut-off distance.
The $E_("direct")$ just employs the regular charge calculation (@eq-charges-in-amber), which is a pairwise computation between the nearest atoms based off the Verlet list we just discussed. To not dramatically increase the time complexity of the calculation, the long-range term exploits the Particle Mesh Ewald method to compute the $E_("reciprocal")$ for all atoms at once a single time per timestep. This greatly reduces the time spent calculation for electrostatic interactions - the nonbonded-term dominant in determing the potential.

To give some insight into the problem, the PBC require us to evaluate the charges in a pairwise fashion for atoms in neighbouring "boxes" to properly account for long-range interactions. This would cause an immense amount of time to iterate over every atom and over every pair of the respective atoms. 
With the Particle Mesh method, we can discretise the point charges of the molecular system onto a grid with equidistributed vertices. Applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we get an analytical approximation to the charge distribution of the system, in the form of Gaussian curves (@fig-pme-fft). This means that we form a function that describes the field of 'infinite' charges very well. This function is then used by the Ewald Summation Formula to return the potential energy for long-range electrostatics .

    For a 2D distribution of atomic charges, we overlay a mesh (or commonly a grid) on the field. We then distribute the charges evenly on the gridpoints. With this discrete distribution of points, we can apply the FFT to get an analytical solution to the charge distribution. With the analytical charge distribution, we can derive the potential energy of the electrostatic potential for the $E_("reciprocal")$.
    _Nota bene_, this is a 2D representation of the PME protocol. The Q#sub("magnitude") just gives a visual to the analytic function. In reality we deal with 3D molecular systems and thus a three dimensional FFT.

The explanation might seem unclear as to why this methodology is more efficient, but this is because the FFT is so incredibly powerful. For some background, the FFT algorithm is used in all fields of engineering due its proven efficiency. A previous application of the PME method (the particle-particle particle mesh algorithm, P#super("3")M) scaled at an exponential time complexity $O(N^2)$, meaning it slowed down significantly when introducing more atoms to the system. The PME method scales at a linear rate $O(N log(N))$ per increasing amount of particles. 

The Ewald method is a way to compute for the potential in a periodic system using the charge distribution, derived from the _Poisson summation formula_, and was initially derived to calculate the potential energy of an ionic crystal lattice system.
The inners of the EWF and by extension the Poisson Summation Formula involve complex mathematics are beyond the scope of this thesis #mcite(("Darden1993pmemd", "Essmann1995spme"), biblio).

#intermezzo("Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)")[
The FFT is the algorithm that supports calculating the Discrete Fourier Transform.
This is necessary to apply to get an analytical approximation, meaning an equation consisting of cosine and sine functions and the coefficients to those wave functions, to the discrete distribution of the charges on the mesh.
We will then pass this analytical approximation to the Ewald Summation Formula to calculate the potential of the charge distribution of the entire field.

=== Modeling Synthetic Nucleic Acids
// ===== Searching for parameters of XNA
// ===== Acquiring models for simulations
// ===== Pitfalls in current methods for modeling (do not use antechamber to generalise torsion angles)
// Using generalised forcefield parameters to represent the behaviour nucleic acids is something unfortunately common in the academic field. Where this forcefield should be applied to facilitate simulation studies on small molecules, for example understanding how drugs interact with their protein, the error in these parameters are often very tolerable due to the small size of the molecule.
// Introducing unrepresentative parameters in monomers that make up the polymer will result in either an unstable structure or unrepresentative one, as the error propagates in every residue of the model.
The current state of modeling nucleic acid duplexes in the AMBER package uses force fields for both DNA and RNA to correctly represent the way the A-type and B-type structures bend and the way the sugar moiety puckers.
Starting from the second generation of AMBER force fields #mcite(("Cornell19952ndgenff"), biblio), the nucleic acid parameters have undergone major changes since their conception in the 1990's. While the derived charges have remained stable, the torsional parameters have seen changes to the $alpha$/$gamma$ backbone #mcite(("Perez2007alphagamma"), biblio), to the $chi$ torsion angle #mcite(("Zgarbova2011rnaol3"), biblio) and to the $beta$ and $epsilon$ angles #mcite(("Zgarbova2015dnaol15"), biblio). As one can tell, some considerable optimisations have been applied to NA force fields to better represent their behaviour. 

One major advantage they have is that DNA and RNA are extremely well described through conventional deterministic methods like NMR. Fortunately for us, all optimisations were carried out through computational chemistry methods, which have become more and more common place over the years thanks to the advances in computer hardware. Knowing this should lower the bar for any researcher to design a force field for a set of synthetic analogs.

Unfortunately, researchers in the field sometimes employ force fields meant for small molecules to represent their XNAs _in silico_. If for example a torsion angle is poorly evaluated in one monomer, this means that every monomer in a duplex will carry this error and this fault is then propagated throughout the entire model. A force field that was designed to represent small molecules ligands for drug design purposes does not have the capacity to accurately represent the global minimum and transition states a nucleoside can go through.
One of the reasonings behind this is that setting up such a force field is incredibly labour intensive. Additionally, since XNAs are scarcely distributed in the database of experimentally determined structure #mcite(("Berman2000rcsb"), biblio), it makes it sometimes impossible to know how it behaves and to validate the given force field against known structures.

Although research groups have been successful in parametrising the Locked NA #mcite(("Condon2014LNA", "PabonMartinez2017LNA", "Xu2017LNA"), biblio), this modification results in a single puckering mode that prevails as the structures is chemically incapable of adopting any other configuration. The trick for nearly all chemical modifications to the backbone would be to be able to represent the different conformers it can visit during the MD simulation. In order to do that, we can realise the behaviour of the modification through a _conformational sampling_ #mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio). This methodology manages to map all the different conformations a molecule can adopt and evaluates them all, for amino acids, five-membered rings and six-membered rings respectively, which are representable on either the Ramachandran Plot (@fig-proteins C.), the Pseudorotational wheel (@fig-fivering B.) or the CP sphere (@fig-sixring).
This can be used to our advantage to computationally describe and model XNAs through pure _in silico_ methods.
