== Introduction
=== Welcome to the thesis

#lorem(50)
Testing this and that #mcite(("Lescrinier2003difference"), biblio).
// Talk about different nucleobase modifications
//
// talk about different basepairing patterns
//
// there is no tool atm that handles nucleobase modifications
//
// this would complete Ducque as the first tool to handle all types of modifications to nucleic acids
//
// However, as we will come to understand in this thesis, different types of basepairing are possible not only with doublets but also triplets and tetrads of basepairing patterns.
