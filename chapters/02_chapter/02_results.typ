== Results 
=== Charge derivation using ORCA
The ORCA QM package does not contain the MK population analysis scheme. To keep the workflow free, local and easy to use, we implemented the population analysis scheme for ORCA to generate ESP charges that are ready to use for the RESP fitting.
Two programs were used to compare Connolly surface grid generation to decide which program is most suited for the task at hand. The AMBERTools-script _molsurf.c_, which calculates molecular surface areas, was modified to output the vertices of the surface points  by which it computes surface areas. A second program, MSMS was also tested (Scripss Research Institute, utilised by VMD #mcite(("Humphrey1996vmd"), biblio) and UCSF Chimera #mcite(("Pettersen2004ucsf"), biblio)). The latter computes a further triangulation of the solvent excluded surfaces (SES) to generate an even distribution of points across the surface of the molecule. Upon visual inspection and level of customisability of the grid (atomic and probe radii, point density), MSMS was hugely favoured.
//
Further comparison of the method was done against GAMESS' output, which defaults to a grid with a density of 1/$angstrom^2$. Our implementation for ORCA uses a density of 3/$angstrom^2$ #mcite(("Singh1984approach", "Besler1990semiempirical"), biblio). Point density of 1/$angstrom^2$ was used for our method to compare against GAMESS. 
Our methodology shows an even distribution of the surface, compared to GAMESS, and decided to proceed with this approach as it produced a near-identical range of ESP values to that of GAMESS' (Figure MKPopAnalScheme and ESPGrid).
A benchmarking against RESP-charge derivation by the R.E.D. server #mcite(("Vanquelef2011redsa"), biblio) was carried out on HNA nucleosides. We see near-identical atomic charges being fitted to the atoms in the respective nucleosides (Figure CompareChargederivation). 
Data points from either methodology were compared by pairwise atom alignment (linear regression, SciPy) per nucleoside. This results in an $r^2$ of 0.985 for hA, 0.985 for hC, 0.987 for hG and 0.979 for hT.

=== RNA and DNA model building by Ducque
A-type and B-type duplexes of DNA and RNA (Fig. SIShowcase A1.) have been built by Ducque and its performance was compared to NAB to assess its model building capacity.
Conserving the planarity of the nucleobases is necessary because Ducque's placement and fitting of the nucleosides in the strands assumes planarity of the nucleobases (Figure BuildComp). Because of their sp#super("3") type hybridisation, amines tend towards slight tetrahedral structures in nucleobases, and this gets more pronounced in _ab initio_ calculations at MP2 levels with midsized basis sets for geometry optimisations. This compromises the flatness of the nucleobase by several tenths of degrees for the nitrogen involved in the glycosidic bond, to several degrees for the amine on the six-membered ring in purines #mcite(("Sychrovsky2009pyramidnuc"), biblio). Optimising at the current level compromises the planarity assumption, introducing distortions during duplex building and causes peculiar rotations of nucleotides in the final model. _Nota bene_, using larger basis sets, i.e. reaching complete basis set, decreases the degree of pyramidalisation #mcite(("Zierkiewicz2008cbsamine"), biblio). Using this basis would be too computationally intensive for our needs and would only finetune details that would be negated in the following simulations.
Therefore, the planarity issue of nucleobases was resolved by the use of planarity restraints on nucleobases during HF-3c geometry optimisations, providing nucleosides for the Ducque library with planar nucleobases, like in NAB.

The quality of the model building is assessed by superpositioning generated models from NAB #mcite(("Macke1996nab"), biblio) vs. Ducque (Table BenchmarkNA and Figure BenchmarkNA), which was done across all (twelve) residue pairs on heavy atoms, for ten models of DNA and RNA each per software. For DNA, mean RMSD value is 0.011 $angstrom$ ($plus.minus$ 0.005) with the lowest value being 0.004 $angstrom$. For RNA, mean RMSD value is 0.169 $angstrom$ ($plus.minus$ 0.042) with the lowest value being 0.109 $angstrom$. The near-zero RMSD showcases Ducque's qualitative output. For the interbasepair-parameters, we see that the Ducque structures are in good agreement with NAB's. Only the roll parameter, for RNAs, seems to slightly differ. This stems from the fitting protocol not rolling all nucleobases with the exact same value, as this feature is not hardcoded. 
The simulated structure for the DNA and RNA homoduplex experiments, generated by both NAB or Ducque, show equivalent RMSD trajectories, as is to be expected given the similarity of the starting structures.
Since all structures minimised without a problem, both the comparison of structural parameters and the following simulations indicate the quality of the generated structures.
With respect to wallclock building-time, NAB averaged 0.272 s and 0.245 s for DNA and RNA respectively. Ducque, averaging 0.328 s and 0.234 s for DNA and RNA respectively, takes infinitesimally longer for DNA as it considers multiple conformers during the fitting (benchmarked with Python3.12).

=== MD simulations on Ducqueâ€™s models validated with (X)NA structures in literature
To assess the quality of Ducque's models for MD simulations, a series of duplexes were studied, starting with (deoxy)-ribose based nucleic acids, which employed the standard AMBER DNA.OL15 and RNA.OL3 FFs. The simulated structures for the DNA and RNA homoduplex experiments, generated by both NAB or Ducque, show equivalent RMSD trajectories (Table BenchmarkNA and Figure BenchmarkNA), as expected given the similarity of the starting structures. An MD simulation on a B-type DNA::RNA and A-type RNA::DNA duplex of identical sequence both built by Ducque, converged into the same A-like structure, as experimentally determined in Davis _et al._ #mcite(("Davis2015rnadna"), biblio) (Figure RNADNA).
A second experiment was performed with the dXyNA homoduplex. This started out from a typical ladder-like structure #mcite(("Mattelaer2021dxylose"), biblio). During the MD simulation, the initial structure of the duplex undergoes a remarkable transition to a highly dynamic, left-handed helix (Figure Dxylo, DistrNormDxyna, Table DxynaBackbone) that matches the type II duplex previously described for xylose based nucleic acids #mcite(("Maiti2011deoxyxylose", "Ramaswamy2009xylonastruct", "Ramaswamy2017xylonastruct"), biblio), having significantly different backbone dihedral angles compared to those in the initial model.
Thirdly, an RNA::HNA duplex was built, using the lowest energy #super("4'")C#sub("1'") conformations of the PES #mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio) of the four nucleobases and were prepared and loaded into Ducque's library. A subsequent MD simulation resulted in a stable duplex that matches crystallographic results on sugar puckering as well as overall helical structure #mcite(("Lescrinier2000rnahna"), biblio) (Figure HNAduplex). 
The methodology of deriving torsional parameters for HNA has been validated already #mcite(("Schofield2023hnaaptamer"), biblio), which has also been applied to deriving the parameters for the MNA chemistry.

The N,N-dimethylaminophosphoramidate represents the linkage between successive morpholino nucleosides, where the N,N-dimethylamino mimics the effect of the preceeding mopholino ring. A sampling of the ($zeta$, $alpha$) dihedral dyad was carried out too.  Minima found at (t, g#super("+"), (t, g#super("-")), (g#super("-"), g#super("-")), (g#super("+"), g#super("+")) and (g#super("-"), ap#super("+")), @fig-PesLinker. A hard ridge ($alpha$ = 180$degree$ $plus.minus$ 30) splits the PES in two. Its cause is attributed to steric clashes during the sampling itself, due to methyls on either end of the linker residing in close proximity of one another at $alpha$ in the _anti_ range.

==== Force field parametrisation
The PESs of the four morpholino nucleosides succesfully provided valuable information on transitional pathways. By using the improper dihedrals ($alpha_1$, $alpha_2$, $alpha_3$) as restraints on the pyranose ring, we gained information of possible transitions of conformations as well as puckers we should be expecting. 
Conformations highlighted in @tbl-ErelConformers are conformations that were initially considered for parametrisation, specifically for fitting of the sugar torsion angles (see Fig. sphericalconvention for a reference to their respective physical location on the PES).
Parameters for dihedral terms of only the morpholino ring were refined by fitting to QM conformational energy #mcite(("Betz2015paramfit"), biblio) . In this procedure, the quality of the force field depends on the functionals and basis sets used for optimisations, as well as which conformations should be curated from the PES and included in the fitting process. The methylated ends were kept during optimisation and the fitting, as the initial problem of internal hydrogen bonds observed during PES calculation reappeared when reverting back to hydroxyls. Iterative curation of the returned parameters resulted in a simplification of the dataset; only the morpholino cytosine was included with the following puckers : #super("4'")C#sub("1'"), #super("2'")T#sub("3'"), #super("2'")S#sub("4'"), #super("4'")S#sub("2'"), #super("3'")T#sub("2'").

For the linker fragment, the minima and transition (g#super("-"),g#super("+")) conformers of the lower half were used to derive partial charges. Since upper half conformers are mirror images of the lower half, they were not considered.
The linker torsional parameters were obtained from GAFF2 #mcite(("Wang2004gaff"), biblio) and are in good agreement with the PES. (@fig-PesLinker C.). The ($zeta$, $alpha$) dihedral dyad values were extracted from the simulation and categorised into discrete integer values, for then to be normalised and plotted. This shows a clear and single peak at the (t, g#super("-")) range, which is in contrast with the standard phosphate, that stabilises in the (g#super("-"),g#super("+")) range in a DNA or RNA duplex #mcite(("Zhang2015polarizable"), biblio). This validates usage of the GAFF2 parameters for the linker. _Nota bene_, a single peak is attributed to the conformational constraints that the linker is submitted to in a polynucleotide chain, which clarifies why multiple minima are perceived in the PES, but only one can be inhabited.

==== Molecular model of RNA::MNA
The RNA::MNA duplex was built in Ducque starting with a 24-mer RNA sequence corresponding to a double-Drew-Dickerson-Dodecamer (double-DDD : 5_'_-CGCGAAUUCGCGCGCGAAUUCGCG-3_'_, residues 1-24) with the geometry of an A-type duplex. All #super("4'")C#sub("1'") MNA nucleosides were ported into Ducque and queried as the complementary strand (residues 25-48). The obtained initial structure was subjected to an MM simulation. An RNA::RNA duplex with identical sequence was generated and simulated for comparative purposes.
Results of the simulation are summarised in @fig-fullRNAMNA. In the last 50 ns of the MD trajectory, a pronounced prevalence for the #super("3'")E conformation in the conformational wheel is observed for RNA nucleosides in both the dsRNA and heteroduplex model (@fig-fullRNAMNA C,D, Table backbone). The puckering modes for the morpholino rings observed  on the CP-sphere (@fig-fullRNAMNA C), in the same timeframe as stated earlier, largely correspond to the low energy regions of the PES (@fig-MethylMorpholinoPES) The scattered, equatorial conformers correspond to residues 30-31.
Their appearance correlate with a K#super("+")-ion that had been enclosed by two MNA residues (30-31) during the second half of the simulation. Its binding induced local backbone angles to deviate substantially from the other nucleosides, off-setting average and standard deviations (std.) parameters by several degrees. Up to four (25-28) residues had frayed (forming $C$, $E$ and $B$ conformers alike), causing residue 28 with guanine nucleobase (mG28) to have its $beta$ angle to twist into an unfavourable position. Structural changes due to K#super("+")-binding destabilised downstream stacking, which causes mA30 to lose pairing with its complement. This resulted in a nearby K#super("+")-ion to alter the $chi$ angle's orientation, of the freed nucleotide, from _anti_ to _syn_ #mcite(("Iupac1983nucleicacids"), biblio). The basepairing of mA30 with its complement was reinstated later, in Hoogsteen (HG), with the ion bound (Figure IonBackbone). The K#super("+") ion is coordinated by mT31:O6_'_, mT31:O5_'_ and mA30:N3_'_ in the MNA backbone and N3 of the nucleobase in mA30.

Coordination of K#super("+") by N3_'_ in the morpholino ring of mA30 forces it into metastable configurations (Fig. IonBackbone-justfig), as can also be seen on the scatterplots, around the equator (Figure ResultFINALSIMRNAMNA C).
As this obvious abnormality is attributable to an odd occurrence of the simulation and not the FF itself, data of mA30 and m31 are excluded in Table HelicalParams, Backbone. This behaviour was not observed in the preliminary RNA::MNA simulations (Figure XNAtrajectories).

Except for the $chi$ dihedral angle with a deviation of 2.39-2.93$degree$, no significant differences in average backbone angles in the RNA backbone could be observed in the RNA::MNA duplex versus the model obtained for dsRNA (Table Backbone).
However, helical parameters significantly deviate from the A-type duplex (@tbl-HelicalParams) with a deeper major groove, and conversely more narrow minor groove, an increase in basepairs per turn and therefore helical size, along with a larger diameter.
//

To investigate a possible correlation of the altered $chi$ angle in the RNA strand to the overall shape for nucleic acid duplex, we performed two supplementary RNA::RNA double-DDD simulations (Figure ChiangleTrajPucker, ChiangleCurves). While in the original simulations the $chi$ torsion angle was unrestrained, in the additional simulations restraints are applied on $chi$ torsion angles at 194$degree$ and 189$degree$ respectively to mimic the impact on the overall helix structure by increasing deviation from the 199$degree$ $chi$-angle in standard A-type duplexes, at 5 $degree$ increments.
The helical parameters of the RNA::RNA duplex with $chi$ torsion angles restraints at 194$degree$ are in line to those of the unrestrained RNA::MNA duplex (@tbl-HelicalParams, ChiBackbone). The observed deviations from the A-type duplex are more pronounced in RNA::RNA duplex with $chi$ torsion angles restraints at 189$degree$.

To compare the orientation of P atoms in the linker in complementary strands, the dot product of the cross product of the OP1-P-OP2 plane of the leading RNA nucleotide and complementary MNA nucleotide was calculated and compared to values obtained for corresponding base pairs in 3 simulations performed on dsRNA (Figure LinkerOrientation). Normalised distribution per duplex type shows a clear peak for the RNA::RNA duplexes around 137$degree$-139$degree$ while for RNA::MNA it peaks at 120$degree$-122$degree$. An overlay of a set of the unrestrained RNA::RNA and RNA::MNA C-G basepairs, shows that not only the oriention of P in the MNA strand is changed but also its position relative to the corresponding P in dsRNA.
