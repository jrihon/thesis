== Methods
=== Generating initial structures
The CS methodology consists of the three parts, where it starts with the generation of torsion angle constraints to produce initial conformations, which cover the full conformational landscape.
The _pucke.rs_ CLI-tool, as well as the _pucke.py_ module, provide simple query functions to generate the desired axes to generate structures in order to sample the conformational landscape.
Using either tools requires the user to specify the type of molecular system (peptide, fivering or sixring) to be called. Both the peptide and fivering system employ a _linear space_ function, which asks the user to pass an amount of points to be computed for in a preset range. E.g., for fivering systems, the inclusive range, [-60. $arrow.r$ 60.], can be queried for an interval of 21, which returns a set of points at an interval of 6$degree$.
For each generated conformer, _pucke.rs_ generates a set of ($nu_1$, $nu_3$)-constraints (Fig.ConfSamplingExplained B.).
Additional applied constraints, during the CS experiment, are $beta$: 208.5$degree$, $gamma$: 30.9$degree$, $epsilon$: 159.1$degree$ and $chi$: 260.6$degree$.
The Cremer-Pople sphere represents the conformational space of sixrings. By populating its surface with evenly distributed points, we achieve a well-sampled landscape. Querying an amount of points, which translates to the set of conformations for the sampling itself, requires a slight approximation as not all queried amounts can result in an even coverage of the surface of the sphere.
These points are then converted into the Strauss-Pickett impromper dihedrals ($alpha_1$, $alpha_2$, $alpha_3$) and are used as constraints for the CS methodology (Fig.ConfSamplingExplainedC.).
The Hexitol NA Adenosine (hA) monomer sampling was imposed with the following constraints: $beta$: 180.1$degree$, $gamma$: 60.0$degree$, $epsilon$: 180.1$degree$ and $chi$: 210.59$degree$.
The peptide landscape was queried to produce the axes at an interval of 10$degree$ to generate 1369 distinct sets of ($phi$, $psi$)-constraints, for the inclusive range of [0. $arrow.r$ 360.]. The L-Alanine (Me-NH-Ala-CO-Me) was used to sample the peptide space (Fig. ConfSamplingExplained A.) and did not require additional constraints. The axes were later transformed to [-180. $arrow.r$ 180] to visually compare energetically allowed regions for the peptide backbone, with the popular Ramachandran plot#mcite(("Rosenberg2023ramachandran"), biblio).
Queries of _pucke.rs_ and _pucke.py_ are given in Figure SICodeExamples A-B.

=== Quantum Mechanics
Each initial structure is subjected to a constrained Geometry Optimisation (GO) and a Single Point Evaluation (SPE) through QM approaches. Here the DNA Adenosine nucleoside (dA) is used for benchmarking since its Potential Energy Surface (PES) is well described #mcite(("Huang2014improve", "Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio).
This study utilises ORCA v5.0.4#mcite(("Neese2020orca"), biblio), as explicitly this version has the latest correction on the D4 dampening#mcite(("Caldeweyher2017d4corr", "Caldeweyher2019londondisp"), biblio), courtesy of Grimme lab. 
The Gold Standard Quality (GSQ) was decided to be the MÃ¶ller-Plesset 2#super("nd") order perturbation theory (MP2) #mcite(("Cremer2011mppt"), biblio), as the CI-CCSD(T) LoT does not lend itself well to geometry optimisations and still a remains a demanding LoT, though incredibly accurate.
This level of theory (LoT) is accompagnied by the 6-311++G (2df,2p) basis#mcite(("Krishnan1980molorbital", "Frisch1984diffusemolorbital"), biblio), with the Resolution of Identity (RI) approximation.#mcite(("Neese2003rijk"), biblio) The def2-QZVPP/C auxiliary basisset#mcite(("Hellweg2007auxqzvpp"), biblio) is used for the RI approximation of the MP2 density, together with the def2/JK for approximation on Coulombic and Exchange integrals#mcite(("Weigend2007def2jk"), biblio), hereafter mp2q. The same basis set and approximations are used for the CS methodology at the _ab initio_ Hartree-Fock (HF) level (hfq). 

The semi-empirical HF-3c LoT#mcite(("Kruse2012hf3c", "Grimme2010dftcorrection", "Grimme2011dispersion"), biblio) is employed as it is fast and cheap and because it has been used in the accelerated methodology#mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio). The double hybrid functional PBE0 #mcite(("Adamo1999pbe0"), biblio), with the D4 dampening, uses the same basis as mp2q but with the def2/J auxiliary set#mcite(("Weigend2006def2j"), biblio) (pbeq). Their usage is reasoned in that both their quality in GO computations have performed extremely well for the fraction of a cost of the pure  _ab initio_ LoTs. All GOs are performed with the _VeryTightOpt_ keyword.

Other methods are the MP2 def2-TZVP/C (mp2t) #mcite(("Hellweg2007auxqzvpp"), biblio) and the hfq without RIJK approximation (hfnorijk). These are used to compare their _consumables_ and quality of results within the LoT with the other variants.

The DNA Adenosine, which counts 31 atoms in total,  uses 103 basis functions for hf3c and 742 basis functions for the calculations with the pbeq, the hfq and the mp2q LoT respectively.
The benchmarking consists of comparing different LoTs' resources and assessing their RAM usage, wallclock time and Disk Space usage and the _consumables_ used during computations, and comparing this to the GSQ.
Comparison of the GO quality will be done by going through a pairwise structure comparison, where differences are measured with the Kabsch RMSD algorithm#mcite(("Kabsch1976rmsd"), biblio) (#link("www.github.com/charnley/rmsd")[github.com/charnley/rmsd]).
All sets of optimised geometries will also be subjected to an SPE with all four functionals hf3c, pbeq, hfq, mp2q.
The MAXCORE keyword is utilised to max out at 1500 MiB per thread engaged. For the GO part, every optimisation allocates six threads per conformation. A total of ten conformations, at one time, can be concurrently optimised. For the SPE, every evaluation allocates one thread per conformation with a total of 35 threads active at one time.
Calculations were performed on a Ryzen ThreadRipper 3970 (32 cores / 64 threads) with a RAM capacity of 64 GiB.

=== Potential Energy Surface
From a landscape of _in silico_ generated and evaluated conformers of a molecular type, a PES is generated, as described by Mattelaer _et al._ #mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio).
The PES itself is expressed as the relative difference in energy ($Delta E$) of all conformations with respect to the global minimum of the landscape. To evaluate the produced PESs, the differences in relative energy($Delta Delta E$) are compared, for all combinations of LoTs, against the GSQ. This to evaluate which combinations (GO-SPE) can produce qualitative PESs (Fig. PES\_ALL).

Figures are made with Matplotlib and Cartopy. Figure SISphericalConvention details on the conventions used to define the CP six-membered ring space in relations to the mathematical convention of defining latitude-longitude coordinates, for graphical purposes.
Cartopy, a Python geography library superset of Matplotlib, was exploited to project the PES of six-membered ring systems onto the surface of the sphere. This was done with the Mollweide projection, and transforming the data by the PlateCarree projection. Because $Q$ tends to stabilise around 0.67 for biologically relevant puckering modes, the CP coordinates $(Q, phi_2, theta)$ were simplified to 2D to better graphically visualise the CP sphere, by neglecting the amplitude.

For the RMSD contourplots, the _oslo_ colourscheme was used #mcite(("Cramericolourmaps"), biblio), other colourschemes were custom maps.
