//=== The _pucke.rs_ toolkit
=== Generating the landscape using the _pucke.rs_ toolkit
In the first stage of generating a conformational landscape, the pucke.rs toolkit is used to select a grid type for a set of axes and produces a set of constraints. These can then imposed on the respective dihedral angles of the molecule; ($phi, psi$) for peptides, ($nu_1, nu_3$) for five-membered rings and ($alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3$) for six-membered rings.
//The constraints are applied during geometry optimisation procedures, which generate all the possible conformations that molecule's system can adopt, given that the query amply covers the landscape.
The constraints are used in the geometry optimisation procedures of the molecule to minimise sampling biases and to ensure the entire conformational landscape is sampled.
The accelerated methodology #mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio) employs two levels of theory to dramatically speed up the duration of the experiment applying a cheap one for the geometry optimisation stage (hf3c) and an expensive one for the SPE stage (mp2q) to accurately sample the behaviour of the molecules subjected to this study. All this comes together to generate a PES that represents the behaviour of the studied molecule.

The constraints of the peptide-like landscapes are simply procured by iterating over the ($phi, psi$) axes in a nested fashion. The values gathered from iterating over these axes are directly used as the constraints of the particular dihedrals. The peptide method returns a 2D grid, returning sets of proper dihedrals to be used as constraints for geometry optimisation procedures (@fig-ConfSamplingExplained A.).

For ring systems, puckering formalisms are exploited, as they neatly abstract the conformation of an N-membered ring system to a set of coordinates. For the five-membered ring system, the methodology has been applied from Huang _et al._'s #mcite(("Huang2014improve"), biblio) way of combining the Altona-Sundaralingam (AS) and Sato formalism, projected on a Cartesian system with ($Z_x, Z_y$) axes. 
$
    nu_1 &= Z_x cos(frac(4pi,5)) + Z_y sin(frac(4pi,5)) \
    nu_3 &= Z_x cos(frac(4pi,5)) - Z_y sin(frac(4pi,5))
$ <eq-Huang>
//
//
//
//
By iterating over a set of $Z_x$ and $Z_y$ values, ranging from [-60. $arrow.r$ 60.], one calculates a set of $(nu_1, nu_3)$ endocyclic torsion angles per gridpoint. 
@eq-Huang simply rearranges the terms from Huang _et al._ to return the pair of endocyclic torsion angles #mcite(("Huang2014improve"), biblio).
The five-membered ring method return a 2D grid, returning sets of proper dihedrals to be used as constraints for geometry optimisation procedures (@fig-ConfSamplingExplained B.). 

Sampling the six-membered ring space exploits two puckering formalisms. Through the use of the CP formalism, one can calculate a set of local elevations from a spherical coordinate $(Q, theta, phi)$, which is an abstraction of a six-membered ring conformation. It has been theoretically detailed by Cremer #mcite(("Cremer1990analytical"), biblio) and applied by Sega _et al._ #mcite(("Sega2011sixring"), biblio), to reverse engineer (or invert) the puckering coordinates to a full conformation. Starting from an equidistributed globe #mcite(("Deserno2004equiglobe"), biblio), the coordinates are passed into the function to calculate the set of local elevations per conformation. Based on assumptions on the magnitude of the bondlengths and -angles, the atoms are assigned a position in $RR^3$. Afterwards, the improper dihedrals ($alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3$) are computed for and are used as constraints.
The sphere represents the CP sphere (@fig-ConfSamplingExplained C.).
The amplitude is kept as a constant at $Q$ = 0.67, as this is the value at which biologically relevant six-membered rings exist #mcite(("Haasnoot1992conformation"), biblio). @eq-GeneralCpEven defines all ring systems with an even amount of atoms.

$
z_j = sqrt(frac(2,N)) q_m cos(phi_m + (2pi m frac(j-1, N))) + frac(1, sqrt(N)) q_(m+1) (-1^(j-1))
$ <eq-GeneralCpEven>
//
//
For six-membered ring systems ($N = 6 arrow.r m = 2$), the equation is simplified.
$
z_j = sqrt(frac(1,3)) q_2 cos(phi_2 + (2pi frac(j-1, 3))) + frac(1, sqrt(6)) q_3 (-1^(j-1))
$ <eq-GeneralCpSixring>
//
//
By definition, @eq-GeneralCpSixring can be assigned as : 
$
q_2 = Q sin(theta) #h(1em) | #h(1em) q_3 = Q cos(theta) #h(1em) | #h(1em) phi = phi_2 
$ <eq-VirtueEquation>
//
//
Which results in @eq-SoftwareEquation, that is used to perform the actual computation for the set of local elevations in a six-membered ring system (iterating over j = $0 arrow.r 5$) in the software. The generated spherical coordinates $(Q, theta, phi)$ are passed to this function. 
$
z_j = [sqrt(frac(1,3)) sin(theta) cos(phi + ( frac(2pi j, 3))) + frac(1, sqrt(6)) cos(theta) (-1^(j))] Q
$ <eq-SoftwareEquation>

==== The pucke.py module
In order to make the methodology more user-friendly, we provide both a CLI tool (_pucke.rs_) and a scripting library (_pucke.py_, a Python-wrapped Rust library) to allow users to implement either option into their own workflows.
The Rust language was a deliberate choice to ensure the robustness of the toolkit.
In the Python module, the CLI tool has been implemented as the _confsampling_ module. Additionally, the _pucke.py_ module contains the _formalism_ module that allows the user to calculate various puckering formalisms for five- (AS, CP5) and six-membered (SP, CP6) rings. Furthermore, the user can pass specific Cremer-Pople coordinates to the CP5($r, phi_2$) or CP6($r, phi_2, theta$) class and invert these coordinates to produce the 3D structure they have defined, as an xyz- or pdb-formatted file (@fig-InversionConf).
This feature allows users to explore and understand the intricacies of the different formalisms, as well as derive specific constraints by the queried conformer.

Additionally, the _geometry_ module is supplemented with three functions to calculate molecular geometries (bondlength, bond angle and dihedral). These work by passing in coordinates from parsed molecule files.
The library provides classes to manipulate pdb and xyz coordinate files, which parse the coordinates of the molecule for further manipulation.

=== The construction of a PES for DNA Adenosine
==== Benchmarking on a local machine
A set of levels of theory [hf3c, pbeq, hfq and mp2q] for the geometry optimisation procedure was applied on adenosine. Every set of optimised structures was then also subjected to potential energy evaluations by the four LoTs respectively. This generates sixteen different landscapes at various levels of accuracy to describe the behaviour of the DNA nucleoside (@fig-PESALL). 
Obtained PESs are compared with @tbl-wallclock) and the consumables (@fig-supplementary-consumables).

//
The selected GSQ, mp2q, were the heaviest computations, clocking in at roughly 548 h or about 22.8 days of calculations. The geometry optimisation capped out at about 48 GiB of RAM, while at most 40 GiB of _tmp_-files were stored on disk by ORCA when ten conformations were optimised concurrently.
The hf3c was logged for the same parameters and finished in about 0.7 h, capping at almost 3 GiB of RAM and almost 1 GiB in disk space in _tmp_-files.
The geometry optimisation experiment with hfq finished around the 30 h mark and showed little hardware consumption compared to the GSQ, topping at 10 GiB of RAM with an excess of 6 GiB of _tmp_-files produced by ORCA at most. The pbeq consumed relatively the same as the hfq, but clocks in at 58 h or 2.4 days (@fig-supplementary-consumables A.,B.).

//
When looking at @tbl-wallclock, we see that the SPE calculations for even the heaviest calculations run at most a total of six hours to evaluate all possible adenosine conformers.
The hfq (max. 28.9 GiB) and mp2q (max. 28.6 GiB) had similar RAM requirements, while the latter still required a tremendous amount of free disk space to store _tmp_-files. All this in contrast to the pbeq that needed (max. 9 GiB) of additional space on disk to run successfully. 
The SPE at the HF-3c consumed a maximum of 6 GiB and ran to completion in less than ten minutes (@fig-supplementary-consumables C.,D.).
//The SPE at the hf3c finished so quickly that only a couple of measurements could have been taken 
The conclusion remains that the (hf3c - mp2q) combination still is a robust competitor in approximating the GSQ, as these calculations are perfectly manageable within a single workday, on hardware with 64 GiB of RAM and 32 cores.
The established protocol by Mattelaer _et al._ #mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio) demonstrates high accuracy, uses half of the resources and only 1 % of the runtime with respect to the GSQ.
//Still, the established methodology #mcite(("Mattelaer2021efficient"), biblio) returned a comparatively amazing result for the frugality of its expenditure.
To combat the storing of _tmp_-files, one allocates more RAM per thread.
To balance the resources for all the LoTs, a middle ground was sought to not exaggerate the resources allocated to the cheaper methods (hf3c , pbeq), while avoiding bottlenecking the expensive methods. This made comparing consumables more straightforward. These protocols, which are targetted for studies on organic compounds, can be further optimised along the available computational hardware of the researcher.
//In the interest of the research, a concession had to be made towards the cheaper LoTs , by not exaggerating the resources allocated with respect to their computational requirements.
//A comparison between (mp2q vs. mp2t) and (hfq vs. hfnorijk) is presented in Suppl. Fig. SIConsumablesExtra.

) <fig-diffErelRMSD>
To evaluate the quality of the different PESs, a closer look to the differences of individual results is required.
Relative to the GSQ, we selected the PESs of the bottom row of @fig-PESALL for evaluation. A first analysis was done by applying the difference in relative energy to that of the GSQ ($ Delta Delta E$) (@fig-diffErelRMSD A.). To look at the quality of the optimised conformations, we assessed every conformation of a landscape in a pairwise fashion to the conformer with the same puckering coordinates in the GSQ and applied an RMSD calculations #mcite(("Kabsch1976rmsd"), biblio), to calculate the difference in optimised structures (@fig-diffErelRMSD B.).
We highlight that the respective ranges in which we evaluate both the $ Delta Delta E$ and the RMSD are small, indicating that the differences overall are minute. The pbeq best approximated the mp2q for 11% of its runtime and optimised conformations closest in resemblance to that of the GSQ in parts of the landscape where it matters (e.g. minima and saddle points).
Its only downside is the time investment into the pbeq calculation, with respect to hf3c, as the pbeq took at least two days to run for such a landscape, while hf3c barely ran for an hour, when all optimisations were run concurrently.
The SPE calculations at the pbeq level are a strong alternative where hardware systems are limited as the landscapes at this level resembles the shape of the mp2q SPE the most.
@fig-supplementary-deltaEnergy compares all SPE calculations to the GSQ ($ Delta Delta E$), @fig-supplementary-deltaRMSD compares all optimised geometries from the various LoTs with one another, for a complete depiction of the results of this experiment.

=== Comparison with literature data
To introduce the CP formalism, an apex (first atom in the set) needs to be assigned for the set of local elevations ($z_j$). The original paper #mcite(("Cremer1975general"), biblio) conveniently chose to have the apex to go through the oxygen atom when characterising sugars, which results in $phi_2 = 0degree$ and returns an #super("O'")E conformation. While comparing this data with what is parametrised in the paper of Cornell _et al._ #mcite(("Cornell19952ndgenff"), biblio) (AMBER Force Field parameters), it was noticed that while the CP formalism was assigned to denote the puckering modes of the conformers, that the reported pucker coordinates do not follow the same apex.
More so the apex of Cornell _et al._ seems to follow through the C3_'_, since the #super("3'")E is closest to 0$degree$, but the phase angle has also been shifted by 18 $degree$ ($frac(pi,10)$), causing the #super("3'")T#sub("2'") to appear at the top of the plot.
This, however, does exactly align with the AS formalism #mcite(("Altona1972formalism"), biblio), instead of the CP formalism, as attributed by Cornell _et al._. 

@fig-FiveringRepresentation D depicts the reported conformers used from the Cornell paper #mcite(("Cornell19952ndgenff"), biblio) and adjacently the nearest pucker coordinate from the previous conformational sampling experiment (@fig-PESALL, mp2q), as the AS formalism. Of note is the broad interpretation of the _Envelope_ ranges, as they actually lean closer into _Twist_-territory (@fig-FiveringRepresentation). The [#super("2'")E, #super("3'")E, #super("O'")E, E#sub("O'")] set of conformers are coupled to a relative energy value. From the GSQ $Delta E$ values, these are (0.00, 1.66, 2.93, 4.65). In the Cornell paper, these are respectively at [$epsilon=1$ : (0.00, 0.63, 2.87, 5.86)] and [$epsilon=4$ : (0.00, 1.04, 1.86, 5.68)]. Any differences are attributed to the basis set used (6-31G#super("*")), level of theory and the constraints at which the geometry optimisations were performed. We see the same trend of favourability in potential energy of the conformations in all three sets of results. The parametrised conformers also fall into place with the local and global minimum and the transitional states, showing the predictive quality of the conformational sampling methodology on the behaviour of these monomers.

For the puckering behaviour of the furanose in DNA, we see a global minimum around the #super("2'")E area, which corresponds with standard DNA::DNA homoduplex configurations. At the local minimum, we find the #super("3'")E conformer, which is often adopted under conditions when hybridising with different types of backbone chemistries. The PES depicts two transition states, or commonly referred to as saddlepoints. The upper saddlepoint (5, 40) locates the #super("O'")E conformation, while the lower saddlpoint at around (5, -15) depicts the E#sub("O'") (@fig-FiveringRepresentation A). Again, this predicted behaviour of the DNA nucleoside falls in line with structural determination data. @fig-fivering gives an overview of five-membered ring pucker modes.

=== Showcase of the peptide and six-membered ring systems

To finalise, we provide a brief showcase of the applicability of the conformational sampling methodology, by applying the methodology to generate PESs on the peptide, five-membered ring and six-membered ring experiments. These molecular systems encompass all chemical variants of biological monomers used in standard and synthetic biology.
The peptide PES (@fig-ShowcasePES) shows a global minimum around the same region as where we would find _alpha_-helical conformers on a standard Ramachandran plot #mcite(("Hollingsworth2010ramachandran"), biblio). Up from this global well, we see one local maximum and an adjacent local minimum ($phi$ = -45$degree$ $arrow.r$ -135$degree$, $psi$ = $plus.minus$135$degree$). This region constitutes where _beta_-sheet conformers are situated. On the righthand half of the PES, diagonally up from the _alpha_-helical conformers, we encounter the _alpha#sub("L")_-helical conformers, whom are involved in left-handed helical protein structures. This behaviour tends to be true for all natural amino acids #mcite(("Hollingsworth2010ramachandran", "Rosenberg2023ramachandran"), biblio).

Finally, the HNA chemistry has been subjected to a sampling (@fig-ShowcasePES). 
At the North Pole, we find the typical #super("Z")C#sub("W") conformers (example in @fig-InversionConf B.). At its antipode, the South Pole, we find their inverse conformers #super("W")C#sub("Z").
At the equator, we find various Boats (#super("Z,W")B, B#sub("Z,W")) (example in @fig-InversionConf B.) and Skews (#super("X")S#sub("Z"), #super("Z")S#sub("X") configurations. To clarify, a halfboat conformer is the same as a skew, where three consecutive atoms are in the same plane, with the fourth in-plane atom located in between two out-of-plane atoms and both latter atoms are on either side of the plane.

  ]
) <fig-ShowcasePES>
Around a latitude of 55$degree$, we encounter the Envelope (#super("Z")E, E#sub("Y")) and Twist (#super("Z")T#sub("Y")) (example in @fig-InversionConf B.) puckering modes, while at 135$degree$ we see their inverse puckering modes (#super("Y")E, E#sub("Z") ; #super("Y")T#sub("Z")). Twists are often referred to as halfchairs and define a conformation where only two consecutive atoms both exist out-of-plane, one on either side of the plane. @fig-sixring gives an overview of the six-membered ring puckering modes.
From the PES in @fig-ShowcasePES B., we can safely assess the stability of both North and South pole conformations, along with the three large local minima around the equator, for the HNA chemistry. Studying the local minima from left to right, it boasts the #super("3'")S#sub("1'"), the B#sub("O',3'") and the #super("O'")S#sub("2'") conformations respectively.
