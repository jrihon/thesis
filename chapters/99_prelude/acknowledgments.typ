// Thank the PIs
// Eveline Lescrinier - Vitor Bernardes Pinheiro - Mathy Froeyen
//
First and foremost I want to thank *Eveline Lescrinier* for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to start and continue a PhD under her guidance.
You have given a wandering soul the purpose he was looking for. Together with *Vitor Bernardes Pinheiro*, we have had many wonderful discussions on research and on life in general, nothing was off topic. I am proud to say I know my supervisors on a personal level. Lastly, I want to thank *Mathy Froeyen* for always being ready to answer questions that occupied my mind. 

// Thank the jury members
// Jef Rozenski - Kalyan Das - Joost Schymkowitz - Jeremy Harvey - Hans De Winter
I want to thank *Jef Rozenski* for taking up the position of chairman of my Thesis Advisory Committee and *Kalyan Das* and *Joost Schymkowitz* for filling in the role of internal jurymembers. I am grateful for the insightful questions they have posed to make me think about my research topic from a different perspective. Their helpful advice only improved my finalised work. I also want to thank *Jeremy Harvey* and *Hans De Winter* for accepting the role of external jurymembers. I can only hope I can impress you all with what I've laboured on for the past four years.

// Thank family
To my family. *Mam*, *paps*, *Céline*, *Arnaud*, *Stéphanie*, *Amaury* and *Alicia*. Though I early on didn't give the impression I was serious about my future, I am grateful for the continuous support you have given me. I hope you are proud of the man I've chosen to become.  Thank you to *Amber Van Bogaert*, *Tom Coppens* and the rest of the family. I love you with all my heart.

// Thank the friends 
To all my friends from childhood, *Shravan Hiremath*, *Michael Favoreel*, *Alexandre Christiaens*, *Denis Shen*, *Jeremy Dehez* and the people dearest to you. To all my friends from Paep Thoen, *Giel Janssen*, *Michiel Cottyn*, *Mathias Schietecat*, *Laura Elst*, *Hanne Claes*, *Markoen Mertens*, *Wito Leroy*, *Kristof Bernaerts*, *Stan Driezen*, *Thomas Lust*, *Thomas Lenders*, *Jens Van Mele* and everyone that partakes in expanding our kot. To *Simme Verschoren*.
You are all part of my most treasured memories and you've allowed me to be vulnerable. Thank you for the eternal support, I love you and you all mean the world to me.

// Thank you to all colleagues turned friends
To all the people I started calling colleagues and ended up considering the friends I cherish dearly. *Charles-Alexandre Mattelaer*, *Shamal Withanage*, *Santiago Chaillou*, *Paola Handal Marquez*, *Rinaldo Wander Montalvão*, *Kiyo Costa Higuchi*, *Sten Reynders*, *Hoai Nguyen*, *Saphyra Thonon*, *Rosa-Maria Määttälä*, *Sisi Lu*, *Marlies Derden*, *Eline Goffin*, *Margaux Billen*, *Stijn Lenders*, *Radu Bulai*, *Frédérick Coosemans*, *Guy Schepers*. Thank you for those five wonderful years at the Rega. \
Thank you to all people I have had the pleasure of sharing the floor with during my time as a teaching assistent. *Thibault Vantieghem*, *Yannick Hoffert*, *Sofie Heylen*, *Simon Leekens*, *Sai Kocherlakota*, *Marie Pardon*, *Brecht Goovaerts*, *Arno Van Camp* and *Juan Aspromonte* made the lab practicals so much more enjoyable. I'll always think fondly of the laughs we shared during the practicals and the evenings when going for a drink. Thank you to the didactic staff for managing the lab practicals so I could have more fun than I actually deserved while teaching.\
Reminiscing about my time spent with all of you will forever leave a genuine smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart. I hope we'll keep on encountering eachother in life.

// Thank the secretary's office
I want to extend my gratitude towards the administrative staff of the Rega Institute : *Chantal Biernaux*, *Inge Aerts*, *Cathy De Meyer*, *Dominique Brabants*, *Patrick Briers*, *Myriam Cornelis* and *Jean-Marie Dirix* for their patience and pragmatic help. 

// Thank you to LHC Plutonica, Farmaceutica and Hades.
I want to thank the people that have flavoured my life since I started out with my Pharmaceutical Sciences degree. The student associations of *Farmaceutica*, *LHC Plutonica* and *Hades* have played a substantial part in my career as a student. The fun, the sorrow, the modest beginnings and the going out with a bang. I've played my swan song before when retiring from the student life and I'll play it again to close off this chapter.
