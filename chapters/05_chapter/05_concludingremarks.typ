== Concluding remarks

*Chapter 2* and *3* revolved around the methodological advances made for the field of computational research on synthetic nucleic acids.

The _pucke.rs_ toolkit should facilitate and empower the computational chemist to explore the Conformational Sampling methodology through simple Shell or Python scripting.
The mathematics behind the different puckering formalisms can be daunting, especially as older literature has this self-evident way of writing. 
//Another difficulty lies in retrieving the articles that the original authors refer to. 
Authors forget that reiterating the literature could be crucial to our understanding of the definitions they employ, especially for articles written 50 years ago where the cited references are lost to time.
The crucial bits of information were often the most difficult to track down.
//From my own experience, the references often contain the key to a solution that might have been obvious at the time of the articles were published, but were difficult to track down.

The Ducque model builder is my personal hope to resolve the gap in this field, with a software tool that is truly modular for any type of chemistry - sugar, nucleobase and linker. This will propel the XNA field forward and to make many realise we are not that far off making robust predictions on the outcome of synthetic structures. 
An important contribution we made with the Ducque publication is that we did not fragment the protocol into multiple articles.
Case and point, the Ducque model builder could have been a publication on its own. The protocol itself could have been too. To slice through the pipeline would be dishonest to the reader. Combining an innovative tool with the protocol itself ensured we could convey all the information in one _dense_ paper.

In *Chapter 4* we were able to use the information from where the project had left off and use it to our advantage. With the additional _in vitro_ identification of the G-quadruplex, the mutational analysis of the hG residues and study on the ionic dependence lead us to find a structure that matches the findings from the biological experiments. While a hundred percent certainty on the structure can never be achieved, it serves as a great alternative to deterministic methods that weren't up to the task at hand.  

The current section *Chapter 5* served as a personal vision board for what I consider to be important. Important for the future of the field of XNA, for the future of our lab's modeling expertise and as an aspiring tool developer. My main hope is that my PhD research will help any future academic - even if I'd help just one person with their research, I'd be satisfied knowing I contributed to something positive. 

What I want to convey to the laypeople that have read this thesis is that _in silico_ research, now more than ever, plays a crucial part in designing new molecules and that this way of carrying out experimental research rationalises the way we look at molecules. Computational research gives insight into the mechanisms at play that can be exploited for our goals, while laboratory research gives us a determinstic point of view with which we move research forward. These methodological branches of science are complementary to one another. Using only one will forever keep us from achieving our true potential.
