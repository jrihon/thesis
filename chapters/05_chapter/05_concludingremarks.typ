== Concluding remarks

*Chapter 2* and *3* revolved around the methodological advances made for the field of computational research on synthetic nucleic acids.

The _pucke.rs_ toolkit should facilitate and empower the computational chemist to explore the Conformational Sampling methodology through simple Shell and Python scripting.
The mathematics behind the different puckering formalisms can be daunting, especially as older literature has this self-evident way of writing. Another difficulty lies in retrieving the articles that the original authors refer to. From my own experience, the cited articles often contain the key to a solution that might have been obvious at the time of the articles were published, but have been obfuscated through time. 

The Ducque model builder is my personal hope to resolve the gap in this field, with a software tool that is truly modular for any type of chemistry - sugar, nucleobase and linker. This will propel the XNA field and to make many realise we are not that far off making robust predictions on the outcome of synthetic structures. 
An important contribution we made with the Ducque publication is that we did not fragment to protocol into multiple articles.
Case and point, the Ducque model builder could have been a publication on its own. The protocol itself could have been too. To slice through the pipeline would be dishonest to the reader. Combining an innovative tool with the protocol itself ensured we could convey all the information in one _dense_ paper.

In *Chapter 4* we were able to use the information from where the project had left off and use it to our advantage. With the additional _in vitro_ identification of the G-quadruplex, the mutational analysis of the hG residues and study on the ionic dependence lead us to find a structure that matches the findings from the biological experiments. While a hundred percent certainty on the structure can never be achieved, it serves as a great alternative to deterministic methods that weren't up to the task at hand.  

The current section *Chapter 5* served as a personal vision board for what I consider to be important. Important for the future of the field of XNA, for the future of our lab's modeling expertise and as an aspiring tool developer. My main hope is that my PhD research will help any future academic - even if I'd help just one person with their research, I'd be satisfied knowing I contributed to something positive.
